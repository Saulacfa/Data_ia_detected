"Even though lots of students like to work at home, I strongly believe its better to work at schools.

Students should have friends in there lives to be more social in the world. One day I saw a student frustrated with work so I decided to help him in America Civil War. In my science class we have projects to do we get in a group of friends to get a good grade and we see a student work by him self. This shows that in schools we should be with other students to bring in ideas, ways that others can't see.

In school you can be well taught and understand better when people like teachers, or other students help them. Those were the things we both like too he was my first friend in that school. I am writing about should students work in schools or their homes. Then one of the kids came up to me and ask what do you like I told him what I love like animals, sports. For example, In history there are students that don't understand they would just sit in their seats and not ask for help. When we got our projects back we got an A and the student got a B. Its best for students to be in school rather than be home school.. Students should be in schools because they should be comfortable when meeting, talking with other students because they might have things in common.

At school students can help each other out in class if they dont understand something. When we took our test we both got A's. Most people think its best for kids to be in school than in their homes because it can help them in their social life, make friends in there world instead of being lonely. When I was younger I use to switch schools to schools then I went to a school called Generic_School I was the only new kid in school I had no friends I was the quite in class, then one day I join a club called book club we just read books and talked about what happen in them. In my class students can be helped by fellow classmate or the teacher.

During school projects students can be in partners or in groups to get a good grade",0
"Fresh air we're use to being home all day and going out to get some fresh air willl cleanse you.. A little of a made up game my sister and I played when we were younger was obstacle course so what I would do is tell my sister that the floor was an ocean filled with hungry sharks and that would make the game more intense because at the time we were very scared of sharks and so if one of us fell of the monkey bars or rope the other would have to start chasing the person who fell until the person who fell gets to their ""safe spot"" which the safe spot would have to be far.

Another thing you can do outside is play a sport, ride a bike or ride a scooter. and sky watching is for you. Riding a bike or a scooter around a park is relaxing if your just calmly passing through but if your racing with someone or yourself then it's fun so both ways is enjoyable to a person. If I go out to bike or scooter I'm with either a friend or a family member because we like to bike or scooter next to each other and just talk or race to see who's faster and better at doing biking or riding a scooter.

If going to the park or playing a sport doesn't interest you and you just rather do something calming and relaxing then going on a walk, run or laying outside with a blanket on the ground and watching the clouds go by is an option for you. Playing with some of the park equipment is another way to have fun for example the swings to see who can go the farthest upwards, the slide maybe you guys can time yourself to see who goes down the slide the fastest, or the monkey bars to see who can get across the set of bars quicker or who can hold themselves on the bars the longest. Riding them is exciting and fun. Going outside can provide fun and enjoyable things to do for example going to the park with friend or people that you enjoy being around with, playing a sport, riding a bike, riding a scooter, and lastly a way you can spend time outside if you don't want to be so active is just walking around the neighborhood either with yourself or with a friend.

Going to the park with friends or people you like surrounding yourself with is fun and enjoyable because you guys can make up a game or play a game and play in different teams and see which team wins first. If you're with someone and you guys want to run then you guys can calmly jog next to each other or have a small conversation while running or run and just be next to each other for support and comfort. Being outside is important because Vitamin D if it's low then a way you can raise it up is going outside because the sun is apart of vitamin D so not only going out is good for you physically but it can also be good for you mentally. Playing volleyball, soccer and basketball are my favorite sports not only because it's fun but it's very competitive and that always gives me so much energy and having energy just makes the game better because it makes both the competitors competitive since the boost of energy makes them tensed and careful to make sure they don't mess up so they watch the competitor like a hawk. If playing a sport is boring and not interesting to someone, riding a bike or a scooter is an option. Laying out a blanket on the ground and staring at the sky is enjoyable to some people because watching the sky and how the clouds move is angelic and peaceful to them, so if you're wanting to do something that includes being outside and you don't want to do anything then walking, running. If you're walking just with yourself then you can breathe, think, or just look at your surrounding look at the trees, houses if they're any near by, or the flowers. Laying out a blanket and watching the clouds go by is probably one of my favorite things to do just because it's very relaxing to me, distracts my busy mind, and I find clouds beautiful so watching something that gives me peace to me makes me happy mentally and physically.

Going to the park, playing a sport, going on a walk, or a run is some of the things you can do outside and enjoy and have fun",0
"Many people believe that self-esteem comes from achievement.

They believe that the source of true self-esteem is achievement.

True self-esteem comes from achievement because accomplishing a goal pushes you to try harder, help you praise yourself, and it is a long lasting satisfaction for you to remember.

Accomplishing a goal pushes you to try harder.

This is important because achievements comes from all your goals you have accomplished and that helps you want to try harder and to achieve many other goals you might have that you want to achieve.

This helps you build self-esteem by making you feel good for what you have accomplished.

Also since it makes you feel good it helps you want to accomplish other things because it makes your self-confidence grow stronger.

Also achievement helps you praise yourself.

What this means is praising yourself inspires you to continue to do many other things.

Praising yourself keeps you wanting to keep on achieving your goals.

It is like an inspiration because you know that after any achievement you are going to praise yourself and that is going to make you feel good.

So praising yourself makes you have a higher self-esteem by helping you feel good within yourself.

Moreover, achievement is a long lasting satisfaction.

For example, you have jsut achieved a goal you've had for three years now it makes you feel very satisfied that you finally made it.

Eventhough some may think satisfaction on something you achieve is not important you should because satisfaction with yourself makes your self-esteem go up.

satisfaction is a result of an achievement and a achievement helps you be more confident with yourself.

Achievement is the key to higher self-steem because it pushes you to try harder, helps you praise yourself a little more, and it is a long lasting satisfaction for you to remember.

If you want to have higher self-steem then achievement is the key.                   ",0
"Clearly, everyone should always aim high and accomplish their goal to have a better life later on.

Furthermore, people should always aim high even if they fall short because failure gives motivation to achieve more and come back stronger. This proves that it doesn't matter how bad failure can be, as long as they come back from it stronger. In conclusion, Aiming high will get anyone successful as long as they keep working hard and fear nothing.. For example, Isaiah Thomas, he was one of the best basketball players in the NBA at Boston. It was one of the worst finals ever for them. They lost very badly, but that didn't stop them from coming back the next year and winning the championship. Anybody is capable of doing anything no matter how bad obstacles can get. Although people believe setting our aim low, and achieving our mark is less dangerous than aiming high and failing, nevertheless, aiming low, and achieving our mark is a greater danger because there's no limits to what people can do and failure gives motivation to work harder to achieve more and be successful in life.

To begin, setting our aim low, and achieving our mark is a greater danger than setting our aim high and falling short because there's no limits to what a human being can do and achieve. Failure is one of the biggest reasons why most of people are successful. Obviously, no should be scared of failure and everyone should aim high and try to be the best at whatever they do.

Overall, the greater danger for most of people lies in not trying their hardest to be someone in life and aiming low to accomplish their goal because failure motivates the person to comeback stronger and have no limits. He's very short, and everyone doubted him and said he's too short and can't make it. For instance, The Golden State Warriors lost the NBA finals in 2016. That didn't stop him from aiming high and achieving his goal and becoming of one the shortest people to make it to the NBA. This shows that no matter who the person is, they can accomplish a lot in life as long as they work hard",0
"I really think that can be really stressed for some students, because there is more pressure for them, because they are taking courses on evenings or summer school, when some of them needs to work or they have to do somenthings at home, but that is a good idea to have 3 years of high school because they are doing just 3 years they can go early to college if they want or another place like NOVA, but on my thought I never will choose to have just 3 years because I feel that can be really stressed for me but I know if want to gradute early nothing is impossible, but if you want to choose just 3 years you have to be positive and had discipline, but there are some students that want to choose this kind of programs and they want to but they are not ready fot this kind of pressure, there is no reason for them to feel bad because there is more chances on the future, they do not have feel pressure because they fail everything happens for a reason.

And my position on this issue is not to choose this kind of programs.",0
"and for those students who have dreams, those who makes a effort to get what it can help thems in the future, for those that knows that life it's not easy, to those students that know that if you don't work for it you won't get what you want on life. I think that the only students that can understand any work and can only attend classes from home, are those who knows English Perfect, because if you know English perfect then you can work in any topic or subject without the help of anybody, If you are a Hispanic born in other country then this program it can work for some Hispanic students because they are used to get everything easy, to get what they want without making a effort.

In the other hand, I think that this program it won't help to those students who distract easy or those who don't do work without any person who will persuade them to do the work, because there are students who likes everything easy, students who don't want to make an effort, this program it won't work to those students who don't like to study, to those who have only F on their classes or those who are skipping, or not going to school.

In conclusion I think this program can only help those students who can handle any kind of work without the help of any person. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

In my position I think it's a great idea to attend classes from home only if you work, or if you can handle any type of work by yourself without a person that will persuade you to do the work, and if you know English perfect.

I think that some students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home. I think that some students might benefit from this program if they can handle any type of work independently without a teacher or any person persuading them to do the work, because some students are smart and they like to work independently, in silence, without people disturbing thems or without too much explanations.

Also. Because for some students it's difficult to wake up early because some students who work on

Part-times, and some students don't want to wake up early, or they go to bed late for playing games on their phones.

Secondly. those students who can handle any kind of work without the help of any person.. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing",0
"It's necessary start to think in the future doctors, start to pass the learning to the next generation, the theories, and the grow of the modern medicine.

This partnership can teach me what the doctor learn all this years. When I first get interest in the medicine area, what I what was help people, be like the doctors that helped my little brother; learn how someone can save lives. can help me to learn more to help others, to help who needs. The theories of the causes for the repenting blinding, or way some patients wake up to the coma and other don't. Today Mr. How will be possible in the future faith with the cancer and the autism to help the people that have it; how its possible someone o broke the cervical walk again. So Mr. Some may think that teenage are just kids and is not necessary think about the future. Talk about the big number of surgery in the kids, and how it's possible do something do the recuperation be less painful to the kid and to the parents. Yes, some times it's, but if you learn knew things this can help in your future, and prepared you to possibility that you haven't imagined. Yes we are kids, but in other hand we are the future and if we don't think about it who will think for us?

It's necessary start to think in the future doctors, the grow of the modern medicine start to pass the learning to the next generation, the theories, and start to pass the learning to the next generation. I really hope that you chose me and gave me a chance to me for prove myself, and learn many knew things in this process that will help me to grow as a person, and as a future provisional that can learn knew things every moment in the medicine area, the future is coming and we are the chose that you want to make.. If it's possible create a substitute to the glasses, what will be the percentage of people who have obesity in the future.

This partnership can help me to learn the grow of the modern medicine. Talk about how the treatment to the cancer cell can be done with radiation, and what can be done to change this process because of the negative effects in the humans body. The reason why cancer happen, if it is in our DNA or can happen with anyone.

This partnership can help me to learn the theories. The reason why when some one brake a leg the time of the recuperation is different; the reason why when a car chars happen the patient has to went to a T.C. Talk about how is possible prepared the kids for a emergency and how act in one.

Some may say that learn knew things is boring. The learn of the doctors can help me to learn why the things are doing this way, for example em de patient stop to breathe the doctor has to put a tub to the patient start to breathe; and if this don't work the doctor has to do a mini-surgery",0
"students will also have good grades and apportunities for them to get a scholarship and have a higher GPA that would help them attened the collage they want to go to. For example nova is an academic instutude collage that has a lot of benifits for students such as saving money for collage. Making a decision of taking class from home can make a huge impact in your life and the future. a video only summarize the story comapring to when you're in class you can ask questions and also have more information from your teacher. students will be able to graduate early from collage and with a really high degree that could benefit them by finding job where they start at the top like others professionals people.

Students will struggle a lot looking for collages that are not too expensive or collages that can help them save money. Students also don't agree about having good grades and a good GPA. Have apportunities of going to others university or instutudes where you can work as an asisting and get well paid. Having a high GPA can help you get into good collages without having to pay and you can also earn money while you're attending collage. How would it affect you, if you don't atten to school?. At nova they prepare students to when they are ready to move on to a four year collage but you need to have a good GPA and have all the requirements that nova asks for.

However not everyone agrees that atteneding to school is benificial for students. For example a high schooler that takes classes online that wants to be a history teacher they can struggle a lot because a video can't give you enough information, for you to know the story. Students will struggle to learn the subjects that the school requires them to take such as History, Math, Science, and English.

Attending to school can have a huge impact in your life. For example students think that they can still go to the collages they want to attened without matter of there grades and GPA that all they had to do is pay. students won't adchieve if we let them attend classes from home. would it be the same if you learn all the materials by watching videos?. . would you be able to ask questions just the same way other students do?. but the question is ""do you have the money to pay collage?"". Nova can be very helpful institutude that students can attened to because they only attened to nova for two years. Having a teacher explalining you everything and working with other students can help your grade and also your GPA for you to attened to good collages and be able to have a lot of advantages.

Students will have more benefits and advantages of learning the materials, if they atten to school. For example if students don't have a high GPA, the most common thing that would happen would be that they will be rejected by a lot of collages. some students think that having to show up to school is a waste of time and that it would be better if they learn by looking tutorials on youtube or being able to attend classes from home. For example if students don't attened to school they won't be able to understand anything which it will cause them to stress out and make them give up on there dreams",0
"Some people think that they can control there first impressions at any time that they wanted to, but thats is not right, first impressions are so fast that it does not let you think, or express in a different way they are faster them a second, there are impressions that can be change, but it depends in the situation that you are in, and other can not be change no matter what you do. It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Is almos all the time happiness.                . Like I personable had a lot of experience that now insted of feel shame or embarrass I only get happiness. Because it is a very day thing that they ask me things that it makes me uncomfortable.

The experiences that people get went they have a lot of firs impressions, are so impressive that they can act normal in a lot of situation,

for example went they were use to act embarrass or shame now they are capable to act normal, because of the experience that they had. Because I had some experience during my life that it make me feel normal now.

I hope that in the future one day, when someone ask me something embarrass, and make me get a moment when my first impression is shame, or embarrass my feeling don't show up, and my experiences take place, for it not to have more affect in the moment, and make it more embarrassing than what it is already, because I dont want it to make me lost my mine, and make the moment the worst one in my life. But when is a every day thing, them is almost all the time happynes, like the feeling I get went my family ask me embarrassing questions or we have embarrassing moments. I agree with this statement, because impressions are an affect, feeling or image retained after an experience.

Some impressions had a really bat affect in our lives, less say there was a time were maybe the only impression that some had was really not the one he wanted, but was the only one he could do, for example let say that there is a student in a classroom, maybe he is not feeling good, and he fart that it makes a realy loud some, and that everyone in the class hear it, his first impression will be to act normal but he could not act normal, because he knows that it was so loud that everyone heard him, so his going to feel shame of him self, his face is going to get red, and his hears and but thats something you can not control.

The feeling that some get at the firs impression is almost like something you don't have every day, well if you have embarrassing moment every time them you may get the wired feeling every day. like went my mom ask me if i had a girlfriend I only smile or answer her that i do not and it is all normal, or at school went my friends ask me if I'm dating the girl I like, the answer I give them is yes or not, like a normal student, I dont get shame or anything. Went you get the firs impression and is not every day situation is almost all time shame, confusion, uncomfortable, some times pain",0
"He was really surprised that I didnt gave up, and after that he told me I made the team as a starting defensive tackle.

In conclusion this is why I strongly agree that failing is a key to success, without failure we as human beings would not be able to improve in our day to day life. Dear Winston Churchill,

I strongly believe that, failure plays a huge role in pursuing success, and I have a personal story and also information to back up my statement ""that failing is the key to success"".

The news article of daily life, had a section dedicated to failing is a key to success, in that portion it talks about how the most successful people in the world had to fail so many times and hardship in that portion of the article it interviews Bill Gates and he quote on quote said that ""failing thought me that you have to try harder and harder every time you fail in order to successed"", and without failing he would not be the CEO of Google.

I personally have experienced how failing is the key to success. Last day of the tryouts the coach came up to me, and told me that he was really proud of me. On my junior season it was time for the football tryouts once again. I kept practicing over the off season working harder then ever. I started feeling really hopeless but I still did not gave up and kept working harder and harder. I was doing really good in the first two days of the tryouts but then I started doing really bad on the third day, and then the coach came up to me on the last day of the tryouts, and told me that I did not make the team. When sophomore season came up and we had to go through tryouts in order to make the team. So I got cut from the team but I did not listen to what my coach said to me. I was trying so hard to get a starting position on the football team. It is because of failing which keeps us successful, and makes us humans work harder for what we want in life.

Sincerely,

Generic_Name         . I was doing really bad during team practice, and one day my coach came up to me and told me that I should quit football, and how it was not the right sport for me. I started doing really good, and the coaches were really impressed of what I was capable of doing. I started playing football in my freshman year in high school",0
"Also it looks when those people try to improve, and they get that, they heard other people. Although i believe it's a good idea to be our self where ever we are. Over all i believe to be my self and the the thing in right ways. To a bad person, or any thing that a society try to make as. But i believe if we trust our self, and have a big goal to rich to. Also not being comfort with it. Being our self shows those people how strong we can be,and continuing our way to improve.

In a word that we see people change accomplishment. Also reaching our goal dreams In a right way. For example. So to be our self, and we chose to improve our life in other rule. So then i believe i should be my self.

finally I believe it is good idea to be our self. It will be possiball to get it. But those people saying to so the thing other, i know that is not right to do it.                                                                                                                 . and they dont know they rich something they effect some other thing that they dont know about about.

I believe it is not acceptable for as to do the same to heard some people. then reaching our goal by trusting our self. Because it show people that they can do same as we do.

When we see that some people really try to change as. To follow their way, and we know that it is not the way we can improve. So if see in society that is changing, and see some people trying to, Change me. We should trust our self to not change. Not believing to any one who come to as, and till as any thing to Change as. Trusting our self and continuing our way to improve more. But being in a society that people as changed. then try in to change me. Or a society that is Changed already, and they are following a different ways to improve their life. Even i do the right thing to improve. and do the things that makes as happy about it. Also they try to change as as the way they want it. over all being our self is better than act deafrient. progress on the thing that i need and want. It is because we see something that is not going right, but the society has changing. Because being our self is mean trust our self. So that way we keep our self in better way. SO i see the can improve but in not right way, and not respect between people. So i should not let ant one to turn me from my goal. That i can rich my goal successfully. Because they way the are saying it could heard people. To advents my self i would work so hard. Then no one can get our way to stop as.

being our self trusting to our goal, and respect our self, makes people to respect as. but they jut look forward to improve. Then going to embrace as for are fail, also try to stop as to rich that dream. Also i believe we can progress people around as. Then we should follow some other way to our life.

Clearly "" is society that is constantly trying to make as change in highest improvement.(Author Ralph Waldo Emerson) I should believe to my self. But is some people who is trying to fail as in our way to rich our goal. Because there is some people who want as, to not rich our goal or dreams. to show a society how strongly we trust our self. As will as we do to them",0
"The first opcion is summer school the scond opcion is evenings school and the last opcion is do not take any elective courses.

My first reason, why i think is better finish high school in three years for students is because all of the students high school are teenager and they need time for do stuff. But students can graduate and 3 years some school has a programs that allow high school to graduate in three years,

this programas has three opcion for gradute in three years. If they can finish high school and three years they can working one year and same money for collage.

My third reason is because all the students who follow this programs could be more opcion for find a good college , and find a good place for live close of the family and find a good job.

conclusion.

I think this programs are good opcion for students who want going to college.. High School

Regular high school is 4 years 9,10,11,12 grade for graduate. So why i think is good idea finish high school in three years is because they could be take drive licenses, insurance, all stuff they need.

My second reason, is because all of the students are teenager, and some working for save money for college",0
"Schools are planing to do two hours of school each week. To being with, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of then hours. That means that those people need a secondary job so they can support themselves

Finally, the economic will increase because businesses are reducing peoples hours just because they want to save up energy. People have debts to pay like credit cards, health/car insurance etc. The pay checks will be reduce to hours worked during the week just like any other job that pays by hour. Otherwise the teachers won't have the time to give the given material. Students must be at school for eight hours. Food cost will highly increase its price.

In conclusion, employers shouldn't reduce peoples hours. it is a good idea to reduce the energy that we consume but in away it's also affecting our economic and learning system.. The disadvantages of doing such a thing to school are, Schools are reducing school hours, teachers won't be getting a salary instead they will get pay hourly, and the economic is going to be low.

I believe that, school days shouldn't be reduce ,just because they want to save energy. Students studies will get interrupted if they get two hours of school weekly.

Second reason, is that teachers won't be getting a salary for two hours of work",0
"I can choose what i want to be. This is why i belive that we can choose our own character traits.. People are not going to tell us when we can or can't do.

I dont like when people tell me staff for example, I dont like when people are trying to make me something im not. John Lubbock wrote one's ""your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I believe that we can choose our own character traits.

Everyone is different we all have distinguishing quality's, put it this way if your an apple and your around mangos every day, is not goint to be different even if they trying to make you a mango your still going to be a aplee.

Going back to what John Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.""

i belive this prompt is right we can choose our own character traits.

We can be happy, sad, angry, or crazy",0
"It'll just take less time to get there, Just as a journey that takes you wherever you go without stopping. Although, some people may say we accomplish more if we are on it all the time.

Inactivity always serve a purpose because in order to finish what your doing, you have to take breaks between them. Inactivity always serve a purpose

Thomas Jefferson wrote; of how ""wonderful much may be done if we are always on it nonstop.""

Will I believe, that inactivity always serve a purpose because in order to finish what your doing, you have to take breaks between them and your body won't shut down while your doing it. For starters, we can be working, but we might be falling asleep at the same time anything can happen. In the end, I believe Is all up to you to determine weather or not to be Idle.. For example, our bodies wouldn't be able to function without any stopping point. Still, some people may say we accomplish more if we are always doing something. However, we might even get hurt doing work hours depending on what your job is. For example, if we are building an apartment or house you name it. To finish off with, we can lose our lives while driving or cost others.

some may say we accomplish more if we are on it all the time, because we can get more work done and we can finish faster. Lastly, even animals take rest after along day of hard work to continue on moving.

Inactivity always serve a purpose, because your body won't shut down while your doing it. Next, we're not even going to be able to sleep with all that pressure building up on us. We might just finish faster without a stopping point. lastly, is great when you don't stop moving forward and accomplish your goals your'll make it.

Inactivity always serve a purpose, because in order to finish what your doing, you have to take breaks between them and your body won't shut down while your doing it. To begin with, that's why now in days we have Saturdays and Sundays off. Second, if we are on just on that we make better results of ourselves doing what we are doing. First, we can learn something faster if we are on it all day nonstop without rest",0
"Even if they put strict rules students will find a away to go around those rules.

In conclusion, this is why I believe some schools should not allow phones in classrooms. Students will get distracted, they will not get the chance to learn more, and having phones is a privilege. Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purpose. Students that actually take notes have a better chance to memorize what they learned and doing better in tests. When teachers do hands on work during class students can learn and teach their peers.

Last reason why i believe students should not have phones during class is ,phones are a privileged to have. Teachers should not allow phones during class time because students will not know when is the right time to have phones during class. I believe schools should not allow students to use their phones during class. People think it is a good idea for students to have phones for educational purpose. Students will start texting instead of doing their assigned work the teacher gave them.        . I believe students should not have phones in classrooms because students could easily get distracted, they will not have the chance to learn better, and having a phone should be a privilege.

First reason why I believe we should not have cell phones for educational purpose is ,students will get distracted. They will start using their phones for other purposes that are not educational or what their teacher has recommended. Students will start thinking it is okay for them to take out their phones when it is time for learning.

Second reason i believe it is wrong for students to have cell phones in classroom. Students will not have the chance to learn how it use to be",0
"It is not a good idea that the students commit to a career at a young age, because it will be to complicataed and difficult for them to take high school classes and their college classes at the same time , however if their high school are select to guide them toward a specif careeer let them take similar classes for example first week high school classes, and second week college classes that way they will not struggle in both differents courses and they can graduate with good grades . Also, it would be a good opportunitie for them to get done their career at a young age and start making money from what they are apassionated on it farthermore, some young people are interest in work on what they like and this could be a great apportunitie for them to commit to a career and start workin on what they have been apassionated on it and get a job that it would be able to made their families proud of them.

Commit a career at a young age give people the responsability to help their families and support them and with the time people at a young a age get more mature in life ,inorder for people to have a great future in life they should take their own responsabilities and learn from their mistake and with the past of time people learn how important life it's ;while people are gettting more elavate then others peple start to descriminate others who are down don't let people wash your head

,always be you because ,today you are up and tomorrow no body no it don't let appearance cheat on you.

Parents have to give support their child with the decision to commit a careeer at a young age, because that's what they want; don't be desagree with them because the only thing that they want is to be independent and lot of mothers don't let their childs be an adult; farthermore, mother's have to impulse their child to make their own decisions and let them learn from their mistakes.

If their sons/daughters go to work or finish their careers far away from their homes it will hurt to their families, understand they're been more adults them your litles baby's no more it doesn't matter if they are your adorations let them be free.

In conclusion,people are allow to make their own decisions and learn from their mistakes and next time they can make better decisions to allow them to choose the better opportunities people put on their life inorder to know what's right and wrong and wich make them to be more responsibles and mature in life.

Many have come to realize that life doesn't always is pink color ,people have to make their best effort doesn't mater if you fall down or make mistakes ,wake up and do it again until you do it right.",0
"Another example is sometimes these activities can help them relax and keep them calm so they stay out of trouble.

Another reason is some of the activities can keep them healthy. There are always a lot of activities and you can always find something you like. They can also do lift training after school which keep them fit and all around healthy.

Last but not least these activities are fun. For example if you like sports there are so many different sports you can do. Students should participate in extracurricular activities

I believe students should participate in extracurricular activities because one it keep them out of trouble, two some of the activities keep them healthy, and three they are fun.

One reason students should participate in extracurricular activities is because they keep most students out of trouble. For example students can do football or basketball which keeps them running and keeps them in good shape. For example, it can keep the students occupied so they don't have to be on the streets. There are also other things like drama club if you like acting, art club if you like drawing, even robotics club if you like technology and stuff like that.

Therefore these are the reasons I agree that all students should do at least one extracurricular activity.",0
"Based on your experiences try to find something different but a little simmer.

For example, if you worked at fast food restaurant you might want to work at a store next time. The first time you won't get it so easily like you thought you would, but though lots of practice you will get it right in no time and better at it to. You will never grow into something you want to be in the future if you don't find your inner indite. An example of this is if you're riding a bike, you fall down, but through practice you'll be riding your bike without falling off of it anymore.

We were all born with some talent that we don't know of, we just got to figure out what it is. If it does then you will be forgetting everything, and the talent you once had, and you'll have to find a new one. Different things can have an impact in your life, but that's how we all stated from very beginning; we never known we had a special talent until we try something new.. No matter what they say, don't let it get in your head just focus on getting to master your talent first.

Practice makes everything perfect even if you found something new, and you want try it out. If you found something you're really good at, then stick with at all times, and never let that talent slip away. Once you've found it, you could do all sorts of things and find what's best for you. Some people have great talents, some have bad ones, but they have one thing in common is that they practice really hard to master them. If you have done some of these, then you are ready to master a new talent. They have one thing in common is money.

Whether having a talent or just practicing, know that you're having fun whether you hate it or love it, and not for very long you will master it in no time",0
"Moreover, if I could play for a team I could play in games compete in tournaments and learn from other people.

Next, this one is huge having the mindset. However, it could be rough sometime, and you could get hurt. Lastly, you get payed really will that is one of the biggest reason why plethora of people want to play professional.

In conclusion, when you do something that you love you dont have to work a day in your life. Another reason, it is just what I love to do. My three major reasons are First, to improve at soccer, next, to have the mindset, furthermore, play professional soccer because that is what I love to do.. Similarly, asking for help from a coach or someone better than I am. The mindset of playing professional. Specifically, if I make a mistake I can learn from what I did wrong, so I can do a better job at it next time. Therefore, having the mindset for my future because I know as I go there will be more challenges for me to face. Finally having a good mindset is very important.

Furthermore, what I have wanted my entire life, my entire life I have wanted to play professional soccer because I have practiced my entire life for it. Specifically, believing that you can do it I can make it to professional. I want to improve by practicing everyday. Moreover, it is like you just started a new life. Imagine running through the wind so fast with something under your feet running by people kicking is as hard as you can for your team to be in the lead. Just imagine doing something you love that makes you exited and it just feels like you have never worked a day in your life, my three major reasons are improve, have the mindset, and play professional soccer.

First, one of my biggest reason is to improve. On the other hand I could play for a team and

I could practice with people better or not. playing with no fear, playing the game that is like a life time. It is a great way to get to meat new people",0
"At first I joined chorus in 1st grade and finished in 5th grade. I like participating in music contests, concerts, etc. I really enjoyed it ,so I chose to learn an instrument, which ended with me joining band. Everyone has a talent or skill. I played it from 2nd grade to 3rd grade. Although my music skills are still improving, I would still consider it a talent or skill.

I've learned to play different instruments such as: the guitar, percussion, xylophone, and the violin, which is what i'm currently playing. I really felt passionate about the violin so I kept playing ,and still am ,and yet will continue until high school.

My music skills can be useful at times, for example: my parents once asked me to play a song for their wedding, they thought it was marvelous. Last year, I sang a song ,that I composed, for my sisters' birthday. She really enjoyed it. I learned everything I had to know in 6th grade ,so I was ready to play the violin in 7th grade. when I entered middle school I decided to turn things around by choosing to do orchestra. In band, I learned how to play the recorder. In my case, Its music. I was also learning the guitar during 4th grade through 5th. After learning the recorder I switch instruments to a xylophone, that played during 4th grade.

Since I didnt really like playing the xylophone, I chose to do percussion for 5th grade. This year I went to New York for a violin concert, it was amazing.

My music skills have yet to improve, but until then I will continue trying new ways of music.",0
""" In this world you decide who do want to be either you get along with it or someone teach you"" although some people think that our character formed by influences beyond our control nevertheless we choose our character traits people on your environment and also people who you talk to i believe that the one that influence me is that we choose our own characters

First People on your environment influence a lot because in front of them you decide who you want to be and you choose your traits so i think that you choose your traits on the type of environment that you are on on you are living for Example My brother Generic_Name when he was around me he was a different person we talked like brother help each other as brothers when he was around Dad And mom he was another type of person he was not the same with me he was more kinder but when we were on school he another type of person he was mean He didnt care about me and other people he wouldn't treat me he changed his traits to a whole different level That proves that a person can changes their traits depends on the environment that they are growing.

second people who we talked too we eventually we change our way to be to different people the way that we talk to our people are a different person when u talk to your relatives friends coasins brotheres we eventually changed the way to be for example one day A guy named Generic_Name recived a call from his parents saying Generic_Name its time to come home And Generic_Name respectfully said Tes mom i will go home right Away after he finish his call he talked to us saying Dude i need to leabe but like right now!! screming that proves that we change the way that act with different people or the way that we talk with different types of people.

to conclude we choose our character traits because we talk and and people around we choos ehow we act aroubd people people who we talk to are the ones that affect us more because thats the one that we do on daily bases the other one people on your enviroment is the way that u want to be looked by different type of people around your self.",0
"This shows students how much they have done by focusing, instead of doing nothing. This proves that students that accomplish more by being on task with their education will graduate with a future ahead of them. We can only accomplish a lot by doing everything in our power to make better this world a better place.

In Jefferson's quote, he was saying that we can do so much by doing something and it is true. It is important that we are making a change for ourselves and our communities. For example, most students that are always on task and doing everything that they should be doing have bigger plans in life than those who do not. Some people may say that inactivity can also serve a purpose because there are people, including: famous people, family members, or teachers who has once been passionate about something they have done in their lives who quit and became someone bigger, but they are wrong. Everyone lives in different ways, but it is important to see what each of us individuals can accomplish in life. For example, in class students are learning and reviewing different tropics repeatedly, which will help us pass any exams that will be given to us. Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... This shows, that if we gather together as a group we can see how much we have done to help these people in need. Another reason why students can do so much with their education is because it can help them graduate and accomplish bigger things in life. Another reason to see how much we can do together is by making great choices in life. It is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing."" Jefferson's quote is accurate because we can not accomplish something without doing something in life. A reason why it is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing something is because we can help those around us. As a result, there is many opportunities we can take to make this world become a better place for everyone. If we put our mind into something and do everything we can to accomplish what we have in mind we can do anything, but if we just sit there doing nothing, we will not have the outcome we expected to want. The only way we can graduate is by focusing and staying on task. Some may see the see the world as being lazy, but we can change that by helping out and planning something together as a group to make a change in the world. These are some reason why we should always do something to get the outcome that we want to see.. For instances, there is a lot of people around the world that need our help, such as homeless people or families who live poor. This proves that when students are constantly learning something they can accomplish anything that they were leaning or reviewing throughout the year. We as a community can feed those who are homeless or can help families who need help with jobs or to get health insurance. As a result, students that are focus and on task are more likely to feel incredible for everything they have accomplished in their education.

Second, a lot of people around the world can do so much to help other communities by volunteering and to make this world a better place. Everyone has a goal in life; to meet those goals we have to prepare and take steps to complete them. There is a lot that can be done and steps to take if we are always doing something for ourselves or for others because instead of doing nothing we can focus on our education to help us in the future or to make this world a better and wonderful place for everyone.

For starters, when students focus on their education all the time there is a lot that can be done. One reason why students can do so much with our education is because often education can prepare us for a big exams. For example, we can plant fruits and vegetables and give them out for free to help people around us to consider to make better food choices",0
". Do you think that the first impression can change my statement?

some people change the statement with the impressions for to made best result or to have a bets answer, therefore not all people can make this possible,

but while the people always try the bets.

i'm disagree because, based on my experience some time i said my first impression, and its hard to change, but is not impossible all is possible if you try the best, my mom said that you always have to change the first impression if is not correct.

My mom said that you always have to change the first impression, because you will be more secure of what you doing, and your life will be more better, and safe, I remember that she always toll me becarefool of what you choice, because that what you do in the present will affect your future.

Some time you have to think of what you choice, and i choice that i'am disagree, because i said if you think two time your impression your impression will be better if you said a best impression, so you have to think what you said because if is not correct you will have a big problem.

Should the people said the first impression, but if you see that you first impression is not correct you have to change the first impression, and make a better impression, because two is better than one",0
"Most likely if all the people you talk to about advice or help, you will pick what they have choose. There are multiple options that can occur.

Another reason this option is good is because you can hear all the others people's opinion's about your choice and you can mark out the ones you have already happened to you in a perfect or an awful way. Hopefully you do talk to more than one person to make a better choice and give up the less opportunity cost. Even picking which choice your gonna make can put more stress and pressure on you. including the rest of your life, your mood for the rest of the day, the improvement, or the impact. Most people talk to more than one person to see their other options instead of putting all one decision into one person's own opinion.

One thing I like about talking to multiple people for advice is that they can give you so many open options to pick and decide from. But still can be able to help others in need. It's really hard to make the selection of which advice your gonna pick.. You either make a good or a bad move, which can lead in different directions. Which can be good or it could lead to a bad cause. Your always gonna have a opportunity cost. Which can make your problem worse of the option your gonna have decide to pick which advice could outrun the rest. You can also, pick their opinions or options and learn from it either if it's gonna be a bad time or a good time. Or even teach the one's need in teaching

One dislike I don't like about talking to a couple of people for advice, is hearing their opinions and advice it could possibly change your mind of you were thinking about before, But also it could be the better choice of the 2 or more open options. Maybe even after picking your choice it could turn out the worst day of your life or the best. When you're looking for advice, you might not go to the same exact person. Different people can give you different responses about your situation. After you have learned you can help out the one's in your same position or a little more different. You can learn from it and help other's or you can learn from it and help yourself in the future if you ever come upon the same situation",0
"Its a little creepy in all honesty but its the world we live in where people just wanna fit in and act normal to seek comfort and approval from someone else even when they dont need. Ralph Waldo Emerson believe that ""to be yourself in a world that constantly trying to make you something else you not is the greater accomplishment."" personally i disagree only cause now a days most young adults, child, and teens prefer to be around the same individuals who act, talk and basically does everything the same exact way. another reason i do not agree is cause this generation prefers technology over human contact so its easy to see why they dont go their own path but instead they prefer to just follow the crowd and not follow what they want its mind blowing how we gotta take an sol too just to see if you smart when all you can do is just sit in a class and listen to a student and see how smart they are without a dummy boy test but im just a young student whos following the crowd just to get a diploma even tho at this point a diploma will barley take you far but it looks good on resume so thats why i am doing this exact test to follow the crowd of dead students just trying to graduate for a family that dont even care if im dead or alive as long as i got a diploma ",0
"At times I dont even get to turn in my assignment when it's due. They can also get a lot of work done by working in groups.

Working with groups is such a good idea because the classmates can communicate with each other , take the stress away from working alone. It's a hassle for me to work on my own because I have a busy schedule after school. For example I have a lot of teachers who like to assign assignments independently and group work. Seeking help from a classmate that's in your group is a good thing to do and you learn more and becomes more understandable.                          . Benefits of working in a group is much easier than working all by yourself. Example one day in history we had a project to do as a group and I was completely lost on the civil war. When my teacher assigns group it's way easier for me because all of my classmates will get to get a job to do with the assignment and we can work on it at school and be finished before the due date. Sometimes teachers doesn't know how to be specific so it gets hard to understand. Not a lot of students like to work in groups because their scared they have to do the work , however; if you communicate with your classmate and assign a job it will go easy on them and get the work done quicker and easier.

In conclusion , working with groups it's more beneficial instead of cramping in the work and not get it done. I had to ask my classmates questions if they can help me so I can understand better and get to do the work. For example, working with a group can help the students communicate with their classmates. It's also nice to go out of your confront zone and make new friends while working on assignments and an easy A.

Being in groups knowledge you to understand better by your classmate",0
"Student should not find a career at a young age because they haven't choose or think about what career they want to have many student think about what career they want at a young age but, it's better to find what carrer they want when they enter high school because student can talk to a counseling to see what they are intrested in and can see what carrer is similar to what they like.

A lot of student have troubling time to find what career they want to have many student career doesn't end so well, once they enter high school student can find what career to have in the future, student can even visit a website to see what career are intresting for them or can visit careers search in school..

If i have to choose a career at a young age i would not think of anything because i haven't find what career i'm intresting in also, it'll be better i enter high school and find what career i like and enjoy because thinking of what career i want would be hard at a young age also, i can talk to a teacher about career in high school so they can help me of what career are available that are right for me and i don't think student should find a career at a young age it would be hard for them to find one.

I have to disagree of student finding a career at a young age because if student do find a career at a young age then they won't be forcusing in school work they mind will be them having that career by now and will brag about it to there friends and teacher no one want to hear thats also, it may not be the right career for them they need time to think the right career they want to enjoy in life.",0
"Some students don't have time to say a few hours because some students have sports to do or they are going do something else at home or have to go see the doctor.

If they add a half hour to the school system I think all most all of the student will not come to school half of the school year. I play sports so I do not have time say a little bet longer of school or I am not on the term anymore.

To sum up I think school should be the some as it is or take sum time of school because is too long to add time to it. I been to school all year except when I have to go the doctor for cheek up that is the only time I miss school. I disagree to the school board adding a half hour to school each day. All in all school help as to learn.. I disagree to school board adding an half hours to school each day. I think is bad because adding another half hour to takes time away from there family and it takes to be with there family.

some children do not have time to see their family in the week days because there mom or dad comes home after they are going to sleep or before they go to school but maybe Fridays to Sundays is when they can see their family",0
"Sharing your interest to others makes other people people share what their interest. Resume help students get a good job in the future. Students can have better life, they can buy a big house and a nice car. posers use your name and picture in social media to get a lot of followers or to get someone in a relationship.

Secondly, students can socialize like meet new people of friends. Moreover students can also share their interest in sports like playing soccer they can show you what part of that game their interested in. Students can be a doctor when they grow up and they can also be teacher or coach. Students can also get away from being a bully. students can also help their family.

Lastly, students should participate in extracurricular activity because it can help them get out of trouble, socialize, and have better future.

In conclusion students should participate in extracurricular activity because they can meet new people, get out of trouble and they can also get their resume to get better job and be successful in life.. Students can also be out of trouble in social media by poser. Also sharing each others interest can lead you you guys to be a good friends.

Thirdly, students can have better future by getting their resume. Like other students they show you bad influence.

Students should participate in extracurricular activity because it can help them find new friends and skills or talent moreover helps them out of trouble.

First and foremost, it can help students get out of trouble like getting into fight or getting detention. Students can also find their new skills and talent by participating in any activities like sports or being a students council",0
"For example, sometimes the students do not know how to make homework, project, etc and they need someone to helf them. Make the classes from home it is not necesary for students because they can going to school every day and work after school and with this method they have more chance to improve they learning. Truly, The school give the option but the students have the choice.

In conclutiong, they not learn in the classes from home that in the school, and this can be affect tehir learning. For example, most of students lose the test because they forget the impormation that they learn in online classes and the time of the test they not remember enyting. It not the same to make the calsses online or in school because in online it is person who teaching for only a short moment, nevertheless in the school the teacher teaching for like 8 hours and helf in sonthing that students need. I disagree to students take the classes on home because they not learn the same as in the school, if students have a question, or doubt did not have a teacher to asking, and Students did not have the same opcion like others students.

The students who take classes from home, not learn the same in the school and this can be are difficult for them. THey not have same opportinity like others students because they can be not have time to make the all thing. For example, most of them have a job and they not have the time to take the classes from home, because they lose the time in the job and when they going to the home they are tired and only going to sleep. Sometimes take classes from home not can be helf students to improve their learning. The students can be improve in the school more that from home, because from home they teaching they self. In effect,

some students do not have capacity to make the classes from home, they needing to make the classes in the school to learn more.

Students did not have the same opcion like others students like the time or the learning. Sincerity, take classes from home it is difficult for students the short learning because they not have the same capacity like others students. Although some schools offer distances learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing. While, the others students improve their life in the schools the others students who make the classes onlone not learn enything because they not have time.  . Some school have this option but it is not a good idea for students because they not focus in online classes and they fail. They teaching themself because in home tehy do not have a teacher to helf them. In addition, most of school believe that give classes from home can be helf students, but this is a big error.

If the students have a question, or doubt did not have a teacher to asking since, they answer themself. Also, every students need a teacher to explain everything that they need to make, and if they make the classes from home is impossible to make the thing good if did not have a teacher",0
"Everyone has a talent or skill. I am identifying a talent or skill I have, and explaining how i develop and use it.

To begin with my talent, my talent is roaring like a lion, is like a deep voice and just pushing air in my throat. My final talent is drawing, i enjoy drawing because i can draw what i'm feeling but i need to be more detailed.

Next my skill, my skill is swimming fast, I only use my arms and legs for more movement and i would need a lot of energy for it. My final skill is holding my breathe long, it's risky but I would beat my friend's scores.

Finally both of my skill and talent, my favorite talent is roaring because I would scare my friends and it's funny. Everyone can do anything, Imagine going to America's got talent and seeing people's talents and skills. I am identifying a skill i have using specific details and examples.. My favorite skill is swimming fast because I can possibly beat anyone's scores. Don't be afraid to share your talent, embrace it and share it to the world. My other talent is hoola-hooping with my arms, just making circles with my arms for the movement of the hoola-hoop. My other skill is running fast, I use my legs and ball up my fist for more movement. My least favorite talent is hoola-hooping with my arms because it's not really impressive anymore.

In conclusion, now I believe that everyone has a talent and skill",0
"One disadvantage that the student can have is that if the students have a job after school, the student can get tired from high school and his/her job. And the student can stop to do what the student need to gradute. Schools offer many activities that students can do after school, also students stay after school to retake quiz or get help from a teacher.

If a student need to graduate early for any reasson, the student need to work hard, and get all what the student need to gradute. All depends in the student, if the student do all the work, the student is going to graduate but, if the student don't do the work, the student is not goin to graduate.. Some of the reassons are: they want to finish high school to earn money to go to college, to take some vacations to pass time with family, also if you are a Hispanic person, you're older, and you have resposabilities, you want to get a good job with a high school diploma, if you just want to gradute early, and if you are a great student with all that you need, you can graduate early. Those programs help students to finish high school, it's a easy way to get credits in a short period time. One of the reasson can be that the student work in summer.

If the students are not able to be in the programs, they have another opportunity, they can take courses online.

In conclusion it is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter to college, but have advantage and disadvantages. But also there are students that they have all what they need to gradute and they can graduate early. The student have to make an effort to graduate early.

Some school offer programs that allow high school students to gradute in three years. Also the student have to do extra work. Some of the programs are in summer, in the evening. For example, if a student is 16 years old, and the student is in eleven grade, the student do not have enough credits, or don't have what the student need to graduate, the student is not going to graduate from high school. The minimum of students are not able to be into theze type of programs. It is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college. One advantage are that some school offers programs or students can take courses online, that can help students to graduate. Students that want to graduate in three years and enter college, some students have a job after school to earn money to college. For example, if the student don't understand any subject, the student have to stay after school, and get help from a teacher to pass the subject and get the credits. One disadvantage is that, students can get tired, they to do hard work, if they want to gradute early. There are some reassons that students have to graduate early. The students's graduation is basic in what they need and want.

Some students do hard work one year early to graduate from high school. A low percetage of students have a jod, resposabilities after school, or activities to do. Some students want to graduate early than other students",0
"Because you have to speak a perfect English, you have to have good grades, your GPA have to be great, and for people that does not born here and is not a legal and just have tree or 4 years studying is almost impossible. . Classes online is the way that you can get your goal, the way that you can feel comfortable taking it at home. classes online was made for people like us, that are trying to study and be a professional in the future. I personally think that is a good option for me to keep study save money and got o a college.

Finally go to a university in United States is something that not everybody can do. Some people think that if someone want to keep study they have to go a school to take that class or the classes that they need. But the most important you can help your family in home or and your country.

Second online classes can be more cheaper than attending a college everyday all day. All my aunts that graduate from high school are taking classes online and they are close to end taking classes. I am planing to got to NOVA but i will take classes online first.

As you have read classes online have many advantages that we can get if we take it. We can save money, spend time with our family , visit many places and the possibility to go a college. My sister born here she went to Generic_School she was in the ten best GPA and now is in Virginia Tech University one of the best universities and Virginia. They save money and now they are capable to pay and attend a college. They feel that some people do not deserved the chance to take classes from their home. They said is more cheap and we can save money taking those classes than attending everyday to a college. But also is the way that you can work and get money. One topic that is frequently debated is about the benefit people receive to take classes online. The people that take classes online is getting many advantages. They can work at the same that they are taking classes, they can take the classes during the flight or if they are in another country visiting their family they can take the classes there. I do not think i will go there i just have tree and half years here, i will take classes online during my parents and me save money to pay a college. They can do a lot of things during taking classes online, and they always have free time to do whatever they want. In my opinion i think that taking classes online is a good opportunity for many people because people can work and study at the same time, those classes can be more cheap, and not everybody have the opportunity to attend a college or an university.

First taking classes online is the opportunity that everybody want, but not everybody have",0
"Imagine you are going to a diffferent country, and you do not know anything about that country or how it works and you have only heard people talk about it or may have seen it in movies. It is good to hear what other people have to say even their personal opinions because you may never realize that you may be in their position in the future struggling.

Knowing as a kid that you have to listen to adults, but you may think it is not neccessary, I have thought the same thing before I was a teenager and before coming to the USA from Generic_City only knowing 1 word in the new language that you are going to be using the rest of your life everyday. My first day of school I got in trouble in less that 1 hour and 27 minutes into the day, because some kids decided to bully me and thought I wouldn't say a word because I didn't know how to even say good morning in english well this all happened inside the hallway bathroom I beat them up because I totally forgot fighting was not allowed in the schools and they said ""He started it he was trying to hurt us we we're just trying to use the bathroom and he came out of nowhere"" and I got in trouble I wanted to say something but I only knew one word in english which was ""hi"". In the town I lived you only used to get water for 2 hours of the day and not every day. But you know you have to go there because the education is not well supported by the government, and the president is corrupt and does not care about its people in your country so that is your option to be something in life. Water is something that lots of developing countries may not have while others have it for their wet weather and jungle like land where it always rains. I was born in Generic_City 2006 and moved to Generic_City I grew in a town where snitching and getting into peoples life is a daily routine because people don't finish school bacause they are lazy and others who work to feed their family and never get an education and if you get to finish everything there arent many job options to enforce your career or to make money for yourself so you have to travel to the larger cities for work and you only get paid for day not by hours unlike the US.Everybody tells you to go to the US but everyone gives up because getting paper is super hard and stressful, the chance for you to get accepted are low so people just stay and get a job at a small store until they die and it is sad because they can't reach all the goals they wish they could achieve in such a developing country.

Since I was 4 years old I wished to always go to the US because at that age I already knew I had no future back there and I used to watch tv a lot and the US looked like a promising place to live at and there we're more job opportunities and I could be what I wanted thats what everybody told you back in Generic_City, and some of it was true you get more chances to be what you want and not end up as a ""vago"" and not be a blockhead.      . People used to say the language was their biggest obstacle even my mom said the same thing well I never thought I would come to the US of A I guess until my mom met my stepdad who brang us here but before comeing we spent a whole month and more on papers before coming to the US.It took a lot of money, work, and time which was the reason I did not want to come to the US because it frustrated me seeing my mom stressed out about some papers that we needed to come here where I now stand.

Once I came to Virginia my mom, and stepdad told me to work hard because the language would be my struggle as well as his when he came to the US around 20 years ago. I was in fourth grade by the time I could comprehend almost what everyone was telling me and all the kids became my friends even the ones who had bullied me a year ago. My school was Generic_School which I used to get taken out of my class for a teacher to teach me english she told me I was the fastest english learning student she had in her entire career as a teacher which I was already starting to speak the language 6 months into the year with no background of me speaking the language in Generic_City. I had struggles with my homework a big struggle my stepdad would come from work late and stressed out and he would not have much patience while helping me with my work and I would say I learned the language because I needed to become independent as soon as possible because it was too much stress on my back not being able to do anything on my own. I came to a whole different world where the school system was different even a math problem was different than what I used to learn back there I was 8 when I came.

Something I really like i the fact that there is snow here in the US because there was no snow where I used to live, as well as water I noticed that there was water everyday and all night here in the United States",0
"There are many more examples you can try to be your best.

Some times adults have to face problem and they don't know what to do or how to face that problem, they think there nothing they can do. But adults tend not to do there best when facing a problem.                                                                                                                              . or trying to achieve you dreams . If you were to give up you would have wondered, if you tried would I have won. Never fail to give it your best, or you will regret it. This not the only example, for example you boss is about to fire you and try you best to keep that job. Unfortunately that not the case. Does not matter if you are playing sports or having a issue at work. No mater how many points you are losing by you try your best to make that come back and win the game. They simply give up. American jazz legend Duke Ellington said, '' A Problem is a change for you to do your best.'' I agree with that stamens because when you have a problem it a chance for you to to your best and overcome it. For example bill gates he did not become one of the most successful people by doing nothing. They give up form the start they don't try there best when facing that problem. For example, My dad got fired from his job, he was depressed and did not care at all about anything. he gave it his best. you can't follow you dreams without trying you best, does not matter what you want to be. They miss out on that chance. Mostly in sports you are driven to do your best when losing. You should be always motivated to do your best.

If you play any sports you know that when you are losing you are motivated to do your best. But you should never give up always give it your best no matter what.

Form trying your best you don't lose any thing you only gain something. If you don't win that game you at least know that you tried your best. He did not try his best. he simply gave up. you will face problems no matter what path you take. So why should you not give it your best .

No matter who you are, you should take the words of Duke Ellington and try you best when facing a problem",0
"My name is Generic_Name and I conclude my subject of topic to one of my most enjoyable educational activities to be the of subject P.E. I chosed this subject because me myself am an athlete in many sports such as basketball,football,swimming,and lacross which is why i feel as if i have a great connection with the subject of P.E since the platform of the class is physicle education which most of the time includes sports. I also enjoy the connection i make with others such as the other students and the teacher since health/P.E are mostly social based activities, were teamwork and cooperation are needed.

This is an art in which others and you could interact with each other which if to the right exstent can bring joy to those who socialize in educational manners, but with that also brings educational activities which is much more of important when it comes to P.E because education always comes first when it comes to any class in the education atmosphere.                    . This connection is established from the joy of physicle and fitness related activities that health/P.E can assure.

I find this activitie mostly enjoyable since it has some of the sports I play in after hours outside of school grounds,which builds a strong connection. P.E may bring a positive inpact on others who need social activites to interact with others,which is what makes P.E enjoyable and impactful for me and much others.

I feel as if this interaction and connection in physicle education/P.E is a great enjoyable way inside of shool grounds that can provide a break from classes which you sit all day and study and is why i choose this as my topic of intrest when it comes to my oppinanated most enjoyable activity",0
"that way they give their best to work and complete assignment on time. Students can study as a group for test they can make some quizzes for their group to study for test that way they can do better in test.

Working in a group is important to students and it has many benefits. There are many students that come from other countries or other school so they should work in group. They think it is kind of challenge to them against other groups.  . So it is great for students to work in groups and to learn many new thing from other students. In group work students can help each other as friends explains something to each other.

Another reason, why working in group is more beneficial, because you can have fun during group activity. It is good idea to show for those students that come from other countries they will love to know the way they work in class and it is great for English learner because By working in group you have to talk more then work. students can focus more than working individual. There are many fun activities in classes that students should work in group like you can debates to other groups on any class topic. Working in group

Sometime working alone can be hard, because by working alone you can't know your class mates and then you don't have any friends to work. So that's why working in a groups is beneficially. Many people do jobs with different kinds of experience people and they work as a groups they get many benefits in group work. Like working on project is fun when you have group, because every person have different idea and when as a group you put all ideas together it is going to be very interesting and by working in group you can increase your knowledge. That turn a boring topic into fun topic so that way students can also work happily.

Finally, why working in group is more beneficial because you can divide work in groups that way students can complete work on time. So students should work in group, Although, working with group is more beneficial because you can know more about your class friends, can have fun during work and you can divide work in group.

First reason, why working in a group is more beneficial, because you can know more about your class friends",0
"then I think about going back to collage and think of all the work that they do and all that im not going to keep going. when you love something you gotta chases it because then you are never going have it.

Failure is a really strong word that nobody likes to like that hear some students get upset for failing a test or class they cant be late because they want to win is just like work if you want to start getting paid more you always gotta be on time and all that. never lose your your enthusiasm because thats your key to success.. Soccer is one example about success soccer you got to learn a lot of new stuffs, Because you have to do a lot of practice. I think he is said is right you never give up on anything, you are always going to wings and sometimes you are going to fail. for example there is a lot of people that have the motivation, then they start winning and fail ones and they give up. And never give up on whats coming next yeah some times you going to fail but get up and keep going so you can be success and become better and always have a good enthusiasm on your life because every body deserves to be success. There is a lot of stuffs that I been done on my life, that now i start thinking i never finish what I start. Why because I stared to get more stuffs, and I wont feel success

Thats why i agree with what The britishs prime minister Winston Churchill said. But I dont give up i know I m going to end up doing them soon. We all hate failing I hate failing, I always think that is just a waste of time. And just think positive that you are gone be sussefull. Lets said that i m trying to go to collage and I stared to work and stared to get a lot of money and all that. so you can become better everyday. That to get where you what you got to fight. Success Consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. I fail so many times but i never give up because I know that I gotta finish what I started ow you are going to success

Enthusiasm thats whats the way to success on your dreams if never use that enthusiasm to do something you are going to be good at it you might fail more than ones but still think about what is going to give you. To win you gotta do something,and do it right all time. Because thats how you are going to wing never giving up. Because I lost the enthusiasm that i had",0
"More than 100 years ago, people used their mind to build machines, planes, rockets, television , bridges, etc. And then your robot went to the market and the people brought it and loved the machine. If you are good at imaging, when you are gonna talk to other people and they tries to explain you their situation, First, you will imagine yourself into that situation. Most of the things were build my their own imagination. Then you will think what should I do to make that person feel better. From your idea, you made the robot and It worked just the you wanted it to work. If they feel safe around you, they will be more comfortable to tell more about them in future.

In conclusion, I think imagination is better than knowledge. Also, In that way your brain are becoming more conscious by your little thinking process and it's making your brain stronger everyday.

Imaginary can make you an open minded person. It can change a lot of thing in the world that you didn't thought of. Our world's one of the brilliant scientist of all time Albert Einstein said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" I think that imagination is more important than knowledge in a lot of ways.

""Imagination""

is the power of mind to make something creative. In a human brain, we do 5% conscious and 95% unconscious things everyday. For example: think that you designed a machine from your imagination about a robot maid who can help you to clean your house , do your laundry, make you dinner, washing the dishes, etc. Next, you will give them some helpful advises that will make them better. It control your body. On a human, the brain is the strongest part of their body. Also, world's one of the biggest thing from a human brain is imagination. It makes you a good person, It makes you open minded, It helps your brain to get stronger. How would you feel when you see your robot went viral in the world and people liking it? Your robot machine went from an a imaging thing to a big successful robot machine.

Also It helps your mind get stronger. In that way,you know what you should in your imaginary work. And that way you will be able to help others'    . When you thinking about anything, your brain is running from one place to another place to get the next task. Sometimes when you imagine something that you know you will do it no matter who stops you, It may come to real life and change the whole world. When you imaging something, your brain brings back the data from your past and puts it in your imagination. Second, you will understand what they have been went through. You are learning something new everyday, your brain collecting data based what you do in a everyday life basis",0
"Determine never to be idle doesnt always make me accomplishing something; putting my mindset towards that goal helps me reach that goal even if i'm idle.. Then one day when I was off, I spent my whole day resting. I think it would be better for us to work at home and be idle thank to go to work and be very tired. There is a show named Jessie, and on this show they have a personal butler named Bertrum, and he travels with them also: he cleans up for them, cooks food, and he even has to open doors for them. In my opinion, I think he's doing too much work than he is supposed to because it can be overwhelming. While I was resting in bed I had time to catch up on bills and any other things that have to do like call in an order for some groceries. Though some people may not agree with me its better to live that way so you can preserve your energy. The reason why I want to catch up on t. Although it may seem like being active helps us accomplish more is better, but it's actually true that inactivity also serves a purpose to. Jessie and her kids are very lazy because they basically make Bertrum do everything; that serves a purpose but then not because Bertrum will be exhausted all time.

When resting at home I have a chance to catch up on t. Resting this day helped me catch up on everything I needed

On weekends, when i'm at home and i'm lazy some times I call a butler to come to my house and clean everything. v shows, or I can hire a butler to do the cleaning around my house. This helps them because while they are trying to rest he is doing mostly everything they need to do. When I was resting I slept up to about 10 hours because I was very exhausted, and gloomy. v shows that I like: like Master Chef, Wild n Out, and also Real House Wives of Atlanta. No one can tell me to not watch it because I am going to be inactive and have a peaceful day where I have time to myself. Some people are always being active and have no rest: thats not good because the human body is not used to so much work being done. Last year when I worked, I was so tired of the job I had received because I was hot and thirsty out in the sun all day picking up trash. I think in a certain point of life inactivity will serve a purpose because people will be tired of all the work hey done and will just want to rest.

While being inactive there will be time where you can rest. This served me a purpose because I was able to rest and get my energy back up to work another time. v shows is because, most of the time I dont have time because of work, or i'll be caught in a family emergency.

Overall, some people might think doing something will make you accomplish something isn't always true. Three reasons why I think being inactive is that I have time to rest, I can catch up on any t. In the world today there are a plenty full of people who are inactive, they sit there and do nothing but have business calls on the phone",0
"I think the author waldo Emerson wrote he reference about like what you doing alone in one world if you care the world o destroy de world if u can alone or need support the people.. If you alone in the world you can make nothing if you trying to make somehting you can't because somebdoy support to you, you can't associate with the technology and you can dessarollate nothing maybe just you can survive and after then you dead, I think i'm agree with Emerson's Wrote,because when you can make all you want individuality i think you can be better because you dont need help to other person or something,so all your responsabilities is with you,when you need to help to the other person somethimes everithing to be fine and somethimes no,because somethimes your plans about you want to do or about you thinking is not really well like about you imaginate to do,the imagination is other thinks,you can imaginate all you want but in reality all your imagination is not the same because you can imaginated much thinks but in the real life you can't make all your imagination about you want is like imposible doing all your imagination perfect,so my conclusion is we can live alone in the world but you need support to the people too because the same time all the world desarollate,and the same time we destroy the world cause we make much contamination,deforetation, we create much machines ruin the world,change climated",0
"At a young age, shows the level of mindset of each person, and who wants to be succesful in life. Each person needs the time to know what could be the ideal career or job in order to keep foward. This is really important, because this will help to molding them as a future adults for the society.

Also, It is a good idea to for students to commit to a career at a young age, because It keeps them focus in their goals. This is really important, and it can motivate students to follow their dreams, and strive to achieve their goals.

In addition, It gives students the time to realize what could be the ideal career for them. That is why is really important to have the time to think about a career at a young age.

In conclusion, commiting a career at a young age is really important, because it can help people focus in what they want to be. Nowadays, the majority of students in high schools do not think about their future for many factors: time, dedication, or buget. For example, schools can provide vital information about the career students may select, depending on the course they like. The student still has the chance to change its mind and can choose the career of becoming a teacher. How much is it cost, how long it may take, and do they need to know about the career. For example, at a young age like teenagers in high school are able to absorb new ideas and words everyday to built their knowledge, and have the ability to apply it in the future for their career. For example, if a student is in his or her first year of high school and she or he wanted to be a doctor, but it realized that now he or she wants to be a teacher. It is a good idea for many reasons: prepares students as a future adults, keep them focus in their goals, and It gives students the time to realize what could be the ideal career for them.

One important reason, is to prepare students as a future adults, because each person has a responsibility as an adult, and this a good skill for each student to learn and built a knowledge when they get to the point of being an adult. By selecting a career at a young age, students can be focus on what they want or what do they need to achieve it. Starting from a young age does not mean people have a final desicion, but it may be an idea in general that everybody should practice at a young age to not have struggles in future decisions, and it would be more easy to choose a specific career.. Schools are a very important tools to help students to realize how important is to to commit to a career at a young age, because It is something that will help them for their future",0
"This is a major reason why I agree being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.

Lastly, people don't try to please others.                                                                                                           . you get the chance to be the real you. Sometimes some of them feel like they are getting rejected by the community and they just to want to be alone crying or even want to commit suicide. They end up falling in an awful situation that may even risk their lives. Some people get lost trying to be someone else that they are not because the society want to change them.

For example, in some countries, especially my country, Haiti, people get bullied for being in the LGBT community. If people keeps being themselves in this world that just want them to be someone else, then they would find themselves where they've lost it and they would also find happiness. Some parent, family members, or friends might not accept them for who they really are, so they have to hide it and try to be normal like every body else. This is one reason why I agree being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.

Secondly, people get a chance to be their real selves. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""to be yourself in a wold that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" I strongly agree. You do not try to please others. Deep down inside they don't really want to, but they probably love that person and they have to do it if they want to please them. As they pleasing them, they end up making that person happy and automatically forget about their own happiness, which is not right. No matter how good a person can look, having no confidence fade the beauty away. No confidence make people look weak and they don't believe much in themselves. Have you ever felt like you have to be someone else you are not? This is something that most people who living in this world are dealing with. However fighting this obstacle can improve their lives and build them up to have more confident. you become more confident. Therefore fighting with this world to be ourselves is one the greatest accomplishment because, people become more confident, they get the chance to be their real selves, and they don't try to please others.

Firstly, people become more confident. As an example, some people may have terrible stuttering problems, and sometimes it may make them feel like not wanting communicate with others, or some people would love to have a conversation, but they might think that they are going to get laughed at because it's hard to get their words out. This is a last reason why I agree being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.

As a summary, be yourself in a wold that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. For example, some people might have abusive boyfriends/girlfriends who want them to do everything their way. Us human being live in a world nowadays that is actually don't want us to be ourselves, no matter how hard we try, we most likely end up not being confident, and having low self esteem. Some people would do absolutely anything to please their significant others or their friends. we think that we have to be someone else to please our society, which is not very true",0
"the students that don't recognized that what their doing is wrong and they don't get privileges like other students do.

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME

1-27-11. The parents ,teacher ,principal ,and the student should sign the contract .The students that don't even try to work hard to get a B average should stay an hour after school to catch up the work they have been missing. If the teachers of the student think that they are working hard to bring their grades up at least the principal should give the students 30 minutes of free time on the activities or sports they want to participate in.

The school should make a contract saying that students that have a C average cant participate in sports or activities. Dear principal,

You are changing school policy so student that have a C average can not participate in sports or other activities unless the students have at least a B average .I think that students that have a C average should at least have an extra class that they need help in so they can pull up their grades up so the students can participate in sports or activities",0
"That's how you make more friends like you want to know what good advice they can give you and you can give them. One of my good friends named Generic_Name came to Generic_school awhile back all quiet and had a soft voice until he started talking to people like his friends and family everyday, now it sounds like he is a whole different person and he is way more confident in public speaking. This relates to talking to priors and family members and communicating because they are here to help you out no matter what.

Having confidence in yourself. this relates to the having confidence because he was scared of talking to people until he starting talking to everybody he saw in the hallways and built his confidence to a new level. I want people to overcome their fear of communicating in the future because that's a big deal if you don't, many jobs out they need people to speak well with other folks. Although some might believe, asking for help (guidance), talking to your priors or family members, having confidence in yourself proves seeking for guidance from experts and authorities about life important matters is a good idea.

Asking for help and guidance. If you start communicating and talking a lot more, it will build up confidence to the point where you won't be nervous to talk in front of a class. My friend Generic_Name was having a tough time choosing which college he wants to go to. People who don't communicate will always have a tough time talking to people, they will be really quiet and lonely at times. Anybody can overcome the fear of speaking just by talking with your family first then friends and people you don't know.

Whats important is that you learn to talk to people like your family, friends, and your school administrators. I think communicating is great because it sets a good outlook on your personality. I always ask my friends and family what to do for certain things such as what classes do you think seem good that I also like or what sport should I join and try out. There was a guy who decided to eat a ghost pepper because of a dare and next thing you know it they are in the hospital, not so good isnt it.    . One day one of my friends Generic_Name from a while back lets say elementary school, Generic_Name was eating lunch and some kid came by and swiped his tray off the table, he wanted to beat they other person up and I said no I suggest you go talk to a teacher about it. Some people have a bad past in speaking to one another but it all comes down to are you going to make a change because that person who has difficulties in speaking, doesn't like it either. This relates to asking for help because he had no idea where he wanted to go if he made the decision to go some college, having no background knowledge of the school and he got there noticed its not for me, he is screwed. That means it is a good idea to ask experts at finding the right college for you.

Talking to your priors, family members and communicating. This relates to stuff in a political aspect basically media because people on there need to speak to one hundred million of people out in the world on TV. I told him to go talk to your counselor and now he's now in Generic_school because he asked about what colleges seem good and are better for Generic_Name",0
"Not because of the time but for those students that would decide that they would not only risk to fell some classes but also not to take elective classes during summer because that's what this prompt says.

It will be more stressful:

As we all know school sometimes can be stressful but imagine how stressful if for students that graduate in four years as every other normal programs that high schools offer, now imagine how it would it be for students that take programs allowing them to graduate in three years. My position about this prompt is that students should not take the program that allow students to graduate them in three years, because is not like taking normal classes, for example what would happen if students get to take the program that will allow them to graduate in 3 years?

They would have to take more classes in less time:

Because as I read in the prompt there was one part that says ""for students in order to graduate must take summer courses"", and this means that they would not have a break in this time. Now that I showed you how hard could it be for students that would take a three year high school program, now it clarifies that theres no need to rush with education and that students should take normal high school program because it wouldn't be so hard as taking the other program that I just talk about, in conclusion students have more changes to graduate with a four-year-program, as long as they keep themselves in track with what they are suppose to do it won't be no problem, and there will be less stress for them, more freedom to take a break when they need to, and enough time to study.. I'll say they have to work even harder, during the summer they have to take courses in order to be upgraded to the grade the are going to, also a lot of SOL's test will be taking in less time, I'm not saying that those people won't have enough time to study, but what I'm saying is they would have a really busy schedule with all their classes plus all of those tests coming up it wont be easy for them.

The reason that why I used those examples to explain the main idea like this, it was for you to understand that such as that program it can be very difficult for students, not just that but for students that might not be quick to understand new subjects or new units, it can get them stuck in there with no option but to get into a point when they would just give it up and quit because it will get really hard for them",0
"After listen the advice the people have giving me i want to give some advice to kids so it help them in their life. When someone is giving you advice listen to them because it could have help them in their life and it could help you to in your life. And when giving advice to those people who need the most it have help them in thier life.

And the reason why people ask you for advice is so that it can hlep them in thier life and they can pass it down to other people.. Give some advice to people that need help with there life.

When people give me some advice i listen to them and i give some advice to the people i know and it been helping them in their own life. Also your family, friends, and other people can give advice that could help you in life and still people are going to give you some good advice. When people ask for advice it can help them make better choice because, it help's them choice better decisions, help them give other people advice, and it help them in their life. I have giving advice to my family, friends, and other people they have make better choice in their life and sharing advice to those who need it the most. I have been giving advice to so many people and it have help them make better choice in their life they have been thanking me for helping them. Sometime i give advice to my little sister so that she can be good at every subject she have in school. After listen to all of this advice it help me so much in life i have made better choice where ever i go and keep give people advice.

After i was giving people advice they came to and thank me for help them with there life and with the advice i gave them",0
"The students cannot always work at the pace set by teachers. If everyone goes home to attend school, funding for public schooling will fall and teachers will lose their jobs because of budget cuts. Even though socialization in the school environment allows students to make friends. If a student learns from home they will feel more relaxed and comfortable and won't stress about work. As a result of this, students won't lose focus on the work they are doing resulting in better grades. Allowing any students to work on their own schedule help them become more motivated to work on their assignments. The flexibility of the time students are allowed to complete work would benefit the mental health and grades of the student. Students being educated at home gain more time to study and make up their own rules but responsible with it. In the near future, school systems and all districts should provide distance learning.. People from different colleges don't go to student's homes and try to advertise their career options. Because of this, students will feel less pressured and get better grades then they would have if they were in school.

There are still a few reasons not to do distance learning. Learning at home and not at school helps students to benefit themselves to get better grades.

One of the advantage of homeschooling is it can be done anywhere and at anytime. Many students all over the world successfully take some, and even all classes from home. The students can work around their parents schedule instead of the parent working around the student's schedule when it is time do some distance learning. Some students have trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pace set by teachers. This is another reason that learning from home benefits students. Would it be surprising to know if students to know that students learning at home helps them not stress out as much? Stress is mainly caused by the students getting to much school work that cannot be handed in one night. With a more flexible schedule, students would be more likely to succeed and make good grades. There many more opportunities with public and private schools. Public and Private schools are great places to socialize during free time. But there is other way around, if you are home, you can eat and do what you want when you want. Because instead of worrying about the rules the students can focus on their studies. On the other hand, schooling at home, the students can easily look up the answers on the internet on a different device. Making friends from home would be difficult without social interaction. One of the reasons students get distracted in the first place is because they are in a class where other just fooling around which makes others who want to stay focus feel uncomfortable. So for all that matter it was you choose from not what want, it what you need.

Students should be offered classes online or at home because it is less distracting and less stressful. The conclusion of the argument was that it is highly doubtful that the lack of interaction could affect the student in adulthood. Learning from home doesn't have the distractions that a classroom has. Distance learning allows students to work on their own pace and on their own schedule. Additionally, that there are no misguided rules about tardiness or how to dress. Students complain about having too much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. In school, you are stuck at a desk listening to the teacher's teachings for six hours and have a limited time to eat and take bathroom breaks. Distance learning can improve certain students learning process by having a more available schedule and by letting them learn in their own way.

When taking a test or notes at school there are many distractions that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. Because it can be done by a touch of a good night sleep, students rise up in morning fresh and have a flexible time schedule. In public schools and private schools, depending on the teacher, cheating is hard to do",0
"for example , I will provided you three reasons why

I think kids do home classes and it does benefits them and yes they learn from it .

Parents are famous and they cant send their kids to a regular school,kids might be in danger and they can attend school because of that or it might be because they have any medical condition.

First reason why students take classes from home is probably because their parents are famous people and they know that, if they send their kid to any school, people will be chasing them,asking for pictures all the time or may be telling them bad stuff. Does taking classes from home benefit students.

People might said that,taking classes from home is a bad idea, that is not useful that kids don't learn and they do nothing. That's why he said that he decided to pay for home classes, and they prefer their kids to take classes at home. It will be hard for them to be free and enjoy school. They will not feel embarrassed to let people see them, Parents know that defently is not going to be the same that it will not be the same as if he was listening directly to his teacher and getting his note but they know that at least his kids are going to be safe and they will learn to they will still get benefits from it.

When you want the best for your kids and you love them more that life itself, you do what you got to do if that means to pay for his classes in other to keep them safe,and we all know that people might talk and told you that doing home classes isn't going to help you. If you know your kid is at home working and you see that he wants to learn the don't listen to the rest of the people.. That's why the school or parents proffered to have their kid to take his/her classes from home he/she will be safe and other people too, the kid will get a really good benefit from it because he will learn and he will be safe and other people will be too.

Last reason why students get benefits from taking classes at home is probably because they have any medical condition and it's hard for them to attend any school. Parents know that in that situation kids are going to be frustrated about it, sad, angry and defently they will not be able to concentrated at school. But you know that is not true, you got to keep working working hard because sometimes students come to school, but they do nothing. Kids will feel free and no body will be making them feel uncomfortable.

Second reason it could be because the life of any kid can be in danger and the parent of the kid and also any school will know it. What they do is get in problems fight, with other classmates or eventhey fight whith their teachers,they used drugs at school but. Because the school will defently knows that if they received that kid at school they will be putting the life of many other kids at school in risk and they will not take that change. Because they know that kids will be safe nobody will hurt them, be hunting them , no body will hurt them, tell them mean stuff. They know that if any kid, that is been treated lets said by any organization, attends to school people will try to harm him or it can become a bigger problem. They will feel shame,afraid,scared and they will be thinking that everyone at school is going to make fun of He/She, that they will bully Him/Her and of course as I have said before parents will never for any reason are going to let their kids to be unhappy to feel bad to feel frustrated and feel that no body love them that's why they let their ids stay at home and take classes from it so that way they learn and no body will harm them make they feel worthless.

in conclusion,parents who made the decision to let their kids stay at home and take classes from home they make one of the biggest and hardest decisions in life. Of course parents are not going to allow that their kids to be harm or kill. For example on of my friends he is very famous in my country and also in here wherever he goes people is always chasing him, hi has a kid that is 6 .years old but he said that the hardest part is when the little boy goes out all of these people get to him and he gets scared. In case other people will said that it benefit kids , that keep them safe and I will agree by saying that taking classes from home benefits kids.

Well I think that parents, who decided that their kids need to take classes online is for one of many reasons",0
"some think that act someone they are no is something better for the world. now and days we see a lot of things, people that are gay, transgender, people that are bisexual, homosexual, now we see all that for almost all the people in the world that is something normal but most of them is not. The greastes accomplishment is that we show how we really are we all have something unique we need to be ourself in order to make the world better.

Being our self with someone it's kinda the best thing someone can experiment, being our self with a person is the greastes thing in the world, now and days most all the people can't be them self around other people some of them laugh at the people who act exactly how they are, some of them don't really care or pay attention to what others are doing, and I think that's how it should be. We can't let the world change how we are. Now in days most of people would wear say whatever they want,

most of the people don't care anymore they just focus on what they are doing no in what the others are doing.

When you show to someone else how you really are is because most of the time, we felt comfortable with that person.. I totally disagree.

We need to stop thinking or worry what other people are going to say, we just need to worry about our self and for the people who accept how we are, with the people we can act how we really are and those people who don't judge are the best people in the world the best accomplishment a person can give is when they tell you that they accept you how you are and that we are unique, don't need to change to something we are not, that is the best accomplishment that someone can give to someone.

I don't agree with what Emerson's statement say because, we don't need to change to someone else. but they just acting how they really are but sometimes it can just be confusing.

Something that happened when I was 16 years old is that I had a friend that always was lying of how she really was, she used to said that she had a lot of money which wasn't true, she did have like the normal she was okay with what her parent had, she said that she was rich and all that, and because of that she make a lot of friends even that ones that were my friends stopped taking to me because i wasn't how they wanted me to be, they would tell me to go party with them, to drink, smoke and all that, my answer to all the was always no, so they stopped asking me, later on they find out that the new girl didn't have that much money as she said she had, the people who I thought that were my friends told me all that and the realize that acting something we are not is not always good being someone we are not, or telling people that we have something when is not true. Well on my opinion I think that the best accomplishment is when someone tell you to be your self, no need to act or being someone we are not, It's better when we can be our self on this world.

When someone act something they are not, they are kinda lie about how they really are, When we chose to be something we are not, It's the worse decision that we can do. We all have to be honest with each other.

That's why I always tell people be yourself no matter how hard it get, the best thing we can do it's to be our self, people need to start accepting others how they really are, Don't need to be two faces, that is how we saying now in days. But I know that every person think different to what others think. I don't think the greastes accomplishment is to be in this world constantly trying to make us something else",0
"Other argue that,it is a bad idea to have a failure. Although, they don't want to make the same error the same time. It is a good idea to have a failure.

The failure can make you better in the future. In conclusion, the failure can help in better ways if they think in opposite becuse sometime we do thing incorrect that if i have a role of failure can give a lesson to do thing in the better.

picking up trash can help the earth that why no matter how small act of kindness it is' it can still have a big impact on someone day. Doing small act of kindness can really help people by if they lost money and you found it and you gave it back that helps them or you clean their car for them that could mean a lot to the person. tell me this when someone is kind to you. I think more people should start being kind to other. that all my reason that people should that being kind to others. and when people show kindness it usually comes back to them in any forms like a person give you a bag of chip because that person was feeling kind. you feel happy right knowing that someone cared to do that thing for you when your being kind to other they feel the same feeling as you do knowing that someone cares about you. It can effect people in a good way by lighting up their day or just talking to people helps them. how kindness can help you is when your car turns off when your in the road people will come and try to help you that's kindness they were kind to come and help you. I hop you liked it. when your stuck on the homework you ask your friends for help there being kind enough to help you. volunteer help people if something happened to their homes volunteer help people for no pay they are being kind. this is all my reason kindness is never wasted and how it can come back to and how it effect people and how it helps them and why you should do it,0
"This will be good for students who live in different country temporarily and are coming back to their countries.

The schools that offer distance learning are making life easier for some students who can't get education of they have to walk for hours to go to school. There are students who can't get education, because of the places they live, like places that are cold or far way from the city. Attending classes online from home would make it more comfortable for students.

Distance learning is good thing for students that want to study in school around the world or get the best education, students can be at home taking some classes that their country does not offer. Taking classes from home is only good benefit if you want to take classes from another school, can't go to school because of where you live or it takes too long to walk to school, and if you don't feel comfortable in school, those are the main reasons students would taking classes from home. I have friend who used to be home school, now he goes to a high school and because he was home school, he doesn't talk that much in school, he doesn't have that many friends, it takes a while to get to know him. Let's say a student lives in France and the student takes classes from United States, that's a good benefit, because you are learning education from another country in a different way that your country teaches you. . I believe this would benefit students around the world, students would be able to attend classes from any school no matter where students live, this would help students who live far way from school and can't get a ride to school. This a good benefit in the United States since there's is a virus called corona virus in some states people are already effect with it, schools are closing cause of that students will be talking classes at home.

In school some students feel uncomfortable of working with their teachers or classmates, that makes students to stop working or lose interest on their work, but when they are home school students feel more comfortable, because they are at their house with their family, they feel more safe at their house and they can trust their family. I remember watching a video about girl's life where she explains how far she has to walk though the mountains for 4 hours just to get to school. In schools one of the main reasons why students feel uncomfortable of going to class is because some students get bully by their classmates, others get peer pressure to try to do things they don't like or be something they are not, making students not to be themselves. There was this famous video of a kid who was crying and told his mom that he wanted a knife to kill himself, he was just 7 years old, the reason why he wanted to kill himself is because many people at his school make fun him for being small, the students at his school were bullying him so much that he had to be home school and get therapist to help him get better and be comfortable.

At the end being able to attend classes at home depends if the students like it not everyone would think this is a good benefit for students others would think that is bad for students to take classes at home, because students will not get the chance to be social with other, this will make students not be able to work or talk with others outside in person, because they spent so much time at their houses taking classes by themselves",0
"Sometimes being yourself doesn't goes as plan as you thought it going to go. Most of time people doubt others. You have to actually think about what you actually want to do to accomplish in life. Most of the time people gives wrong advice to others. Only if it is for the good. I agree with this statement. Are you happy with your self? Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" Do you agree or disagree with this statement? I agree with this statement, being yourself and not letting people change you is a great accomplishment. One should never allow someone to change you.

To be yourself is the best way to the greatest accomplishment because people try to persuade you or talk to you about doing something else that doesn't impressed you.        . You don't have to listen to what other people say and tell you. You can help them out by saying "" what you doing is not a great decision, you should have better choices then getting into trouble."" Another example, is if someone is having a difficult time, you could help them by giving them good advice how to accomplish something.

Being yourself lead to great accomplishment. You have to believe in yourself, that you can accomplish greater thing just doing what you admire.

Go with what you think its a good decision for you, either being by yourself or need someone to tell you what to do. In my decision being yourself and actually knowing what to do is the best decision to the greatest accomplishment. Sometime people try to change you because they thought you couldn't succeed with what you wanted to become or wanted to accomplish. Having a strong feeling that being by yourself is a good decision for you, that a good thing because thats means you have no problems of being by yourself. If you know that you going to succeed in life then that amazing because you believe in yourself . Go with that decision that you think is right and don't allow nobody to make you do something that you don't think is wrong.

However, there are people who think allowing someone to change you can be an accomplishment. For example, if someone is having a hard time being a good citizen and they are always getting into trouble, then yes changing them is a good thing",0
"Boom!One day PROPER_NAME mom decided that she wanted him to join the distance learning classes.Where they could have online or video conferences with there school teachers.PROPER_NAME would sit around all day on his phone playing videos games instead of doing his online or video conferences.PROPER_NAME is like many others who thinks school is not all that important.I believe that schools should not offer distance learning to students.Therefore,students would not benefit from attending classes at home because students would have more free-time, students would be discourage that school is not important,Also they would skip classes to meet up with friends.

First,students would have free-time.For example,PROPER_NAME was home alone because her mom and dad works at a fast-food restaurant called LOCATION_NAME.PROPER_NAME knows she would have online conferences in the morning the next day at 8:30.Next morning came PROPER_NAME decided that she was not doing any conferences because she wanted to go shopping at the mall

for a up coming beach day that her aunt PROPER_NAME was having.PROPER_NAME then spend all day at the mall walking around looking in stores and talking to friends.Another example,There was a Vybz Kartel performance in LOCATION_NAME where they would give away free food and drinks at the gate. Another example, PROPER_NAME dad PROPER_NAME just brought this new speedboat.one day when her dad was not at home she decided it is better not to do her online or video conference she was just going to invite sum of her friends over and they could take the boat for a spin at a hotel called HOTEL_NAME.They spent all day boating around instead of her doing her online classes.Another example, PROPER_NAME woke up one Monday morning saying she doesn't feel like she has a need to be taking distance learning classes so she pack her bag and call her friend PROPER_NAME to go with her to the countyside to look on lakes,mountain,and also valley.

Lastly,students would get discourage that school is not that important.For example, PROPER_NAME was taking AP biology class because she wanted to be a doctor, but because her mom start letting her taking online conferences for biology and start staying home she get discourage that school is not that important because if it was why would they would her to stay her.Next example, PROPER_NAME wanted to be a color guard coach but her aunt was telling her she does not have enough money to pay for her to attend the color guard practices her aunt heard about this distance learning program where she could stay home and learning about the skills for color guard for free. PROPER_NAME then left home after listing to her moms voice mail saying that she needs some alone time so she have to attend this party because all her friends were going and she wanted not to feel left out.Additional, PROPER_NAME boyfriend PROPER_NAME texted her saying he want to spend the day with her because he was leaving on October the 26,to go and stay for sum time in LOCATION_NAME with his dad. PROPER_NAME mom make sure to call home and remind her that she would have video conference in the afternoon with the teacher she loves the most PROPER_NAME but there was no answer so her mom decided to leave a voice mail ad hope when she sees the message she will know what to do. PROPER_NAME then got up pack a bag with clothe then left without anyone know she was out of the house without studying for her online conference presentation.c

Secondly,students would skip classes to meet up with friends.For example, PROPER_NAME skip distance learning classes to go enjoy the day with her best friend PROPER_NAME because it was his birthday and he invites her out for ice-cream and horse back riding. In addition, as for PROPER_NAME hanging out with his friends skiing in glove on snowboard or ice hockey is way cooler then staying home listening to his online conference teacher talk. PROPER_NAME decided that if that could help she would take the class after two days PROPER_NAME said to her mom that the distance learning is not working out the way she wanted it to be also that is lower her expectation about school.Some people believe that if school offer distance learning to students it would allow them to have freedom.They are incorrect because most students are responsible.",0
"But not always people have the same motivation or satisfaction to stand up and fight for what should be helpful and worthy. They also know that believing in themselves will improve their capacity and potential to be successful. But they will always give their lives to make it real and that's when they realized that all the effort was for a good reason to be on where they are now.

Those who keeps a positive attitude are the ones to inspire other people by writing books, quotes, poems, etc. Because later on we won't have second chance to prove our skills and be someone important to admire.

Although people who has a positive attitude are trustful, smart, and kind etc. Even they will shine like a pearl for the effort and work ethic. When people tries the best to do well at school there's an increase of chances to be committee for an University, because they look for all the things students do well and because the success for people is believe on what they can do right and how can do it to bright out there.. People look at them as a way to motivate themselves and believe they can do the same to reach their goals. Even they could help people to reach their dreams. As they know being focus is the key to succeed in life. But if they do not put a bit of effort to make it won't happened. Most people tend to give up, because they think it's complicated or hard to get it. They used to give to be positionated far way from others like one of the success person ever seen before.

School, Grades, Homework are important to the success in life. People who are motivated all the time tend to rich a 99% of their goals easily at school or Colleges. Most people create their own way or destiny to go in life. But those who has never tried are the ones to come last , because they do not have enough motivation or self-confidence to do it.

In some cases people are reponsible for their own motivation in life and what'd help them to be successful it is to take good decison.

There are so many opportunities out there, that will make us to be better and what we don't have to do is to make mistakes that will lead us to bad life style. Sometimes people apply their concepts as how to be successful in life and what it is required to the success of school. The success of a person is being dedicated all the time and no matter how hard it's going to be. People just have to be apassionate for things they love to do in their daily life and the opportunity to prove they are better",0
"People use technology to find resources that are very helpful. Technology have a very negative effect on the peoples lives. Some parents let their kids to use technology and avoid what it can do to their kids. Young people don't get enough sleep because they use their phones and stay up late. Some parents do care about their kids health issues and they take their devices away. If someone could take the technology away from young people, they would not communicate with their parents or not even make an eye contact with them. Technology effects different kinds of people young and old. Technology is bad for people because it changes the way people live their lives. A lot of people die in car accidents on account of them using technology while driving a car. When people are using technology, they can't focus on what the other person is saying. People see negative effects of the technology and then they use them. Technology can cause people to perform bad things.

"people have different opinion about failure, some say failure is the worst thing that can happen to you, and it makes you not want to try your best on something . it gives us the the corrage to try something over and over until you gat it, it makes us humans learn from our mistakes, and it gives us the strenth

First failure gives us the corrage to try something over and over until you gat it because, I have fail before when I was trying out for the school soccer team, I work so hard for it I go to training everytime, and be there on time but i did not made the team I was so sad that i did not made the team but it give me the corrage to try more and more.

Second failure makes us humans learn from our mistakes. it like me I am a teenager who cant speak english everwell, whenever I spoke to someone my age thay kept on making fun of me, but I never give up on myseif I know that if I learn from my mistakes I will be better at speaking english.

Finally failure make us stronger. failure play a enthusiasm in our lives that makes the world a better place. There is a quote about success contsists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. we humans are not parfect we all make mistake and learn for it. everyone go through failure for example president Donold Trump in other to be a president he has to go through som failure.

In conclusion failure is the best thing that can happend to us humans. in life in other to get what we want we have to go throught failure it teach us to be strong and to nevergive up on yourseif.         . however in my opinion, I thing failure is the best thing that can happened to us humans because. it teach us to be strong in anything that we want and to learn from our mistakes",0
"I worked extra hours in past jobs before because for one my work co workers because they were sick. I'm always willing to do something new and challenging so I can extend the things I know, All I want you to know is that what ever you tell to do I will give my one hundred percent.

As you have read this why I think I make a good candidate and a good addition to your team. Most companies look for specific characteristics in potential employees. But sometimes those people aren't good working with other people and in my opinion that is very important to keep and good work environment. I think only when you see me actually working in your company and see the things I'm able to bring to the table you will see I was the best option for the job. Thank you for reading and taking my application for consideration. Although I dont know how to do much of what this type of does, I'll do my best to learn it as fast as possible so I can give you the best results I can give. That's why I'm willing to work longer hours so those workers can take that break they so much desire.

Finally, I'm a hard worker like you read in the last paragraph I'm willing to work longer hours, so that should give you an idea. What ever job you give me I'll do it at the best of my ability, it doesn't matter what it is I'll do it. I'm good working with people, I'm willing work longer hours if needed, and I'm a hard worker. Because we all need a break sometimes, but there are times where we can't give the workers that break because the company doesn't have enough people to cover that person. One of the things I enjoy the most about working is the ability to work and share ideas with people in my past jobs, I feel like it makes the work environment a lot better because it make the work easier and more enjoyable. I think I'm a very good candidate because, I'm good working with people, I am always willing to work extra hours if you need me to, and finally I'm may not have much experience on this kind of work but I'm a pretty hard worker and will try my absolute best to learn the job.

One reason, I think I should be hired is that I'm good working with people. Because the more are working together the job gets done faster, I'm always willing to help if anybody needs me I'll be there planning things out with the person give him/her feed back on what she thinks and work out something that can work for both the company and themselves.        . So if you ever need me to work for extra hours don't hesitate to give me a call. I try get along with all my work partners so I can make it the best experience for me and for everyone else around me.

Another reason, is I'm always willing to work extra hours if needed. Some people think that companies shouldn't look for specific characteristic in people and let the person thats applying, get the job and learn while he/she is working with the company.

Some people have a better education than others, which that would be one of the characteristics that company would be looking for, trying to hire someone. I hope you consider hiring me and i hope the best for the company",0
"I told him that yes It was going to be hard but he had a lots of skills and knowleage about it and it would take less time for him to learn what they do there. That was not inetersted any more and told that he didn't have enough skills and it was going to be to hard for him. I played almost all games I got a record, and I archieve one goal that was to proved to me that I could play at a high level even knowing that a year before I was scare to try out.

Another reason Its that really frecuently that people got scared to try a challenge, and to show themself that they can do thing at a higher level than what they think. A similar expample is one of my cousins knew how to work in construction in El Salvador and he was really good at it, and when he just got here in US he knew that there was contruction sites and places that he could work on it. He said he was going to think about it and after a time he got the joob and it olny took him less than a month to know how they operated there and got hired more fast than others, because he was doing a good joob on everything that he has to do. And at the beggining of my third season our captain left ,and I got surprised that all all in the team wan't it me as a captain and my coach said that I was the captain of the teamI just got really happy.

And won the league and the All Starts tournament that year and since there I have played like 8 season because every year there are 2. I have won for my third year in a row the best goalkeeper in the league. And for the next season he was loking for a goalkeeper and I accept it to got in because my friends convinced me to join. He told me that he was happy to take that joob and first he was wrong when he said that he had not enought skills for that joob.

Also another reason of why I agree with Michelangelo is that I remenber that around 3 and the hallf years ago I played soccer just with friends afterschool and we played just for fun and to relax. I didin't whant it to play for a team because I felt that I was not to good to play for them. And I thought about that I could make it to play with which ever one, but when one of my friends told me that a lot of students were going to try out. These happened when I was at my last school Generic_School, I knew that the practices to try out for the teams were going to start in 2 days. I didn't accept to play with my school and next year I did the try outs just to see if at least I have a good level compared to others and the coach saw how I played and he put my on Varsity team. First no one was interested on my and after some seasons almost all team in Generic_City teams whant it me and teams from Generic_City I had like 7 teams that whant it me to play with them.

In conclusion I strongly agree with Michelangelo's words, its really common that the worst danger for most of us is to set our aim too low and achieving less than what we can do, I have had some reason and example but in all of them I realise that if I work hard I can accomplish more than I think I deserve.. I agree with Michelangelo's words, because some time when we whant to do things we start a low level because we think we aren't not good enough to do it, even known that we can do it good. One day I was playing soccer afterschool with some friends, and one of my friends dad was a coach for a team of Generic_City and remenbered that he said to all of us that if we whant it to play for him in his team. When he told me that I thought that wasen't good enough and that others could be a lot better than me, so I decided to not try out and I was already playing for one team of Generic_City and they told that if I whant it I could play for both and I answered no. All my friend got in the team and I was the only one that did not got in, because I felt that I wasen't good enought so i decided to not join the team. First he told me that we was excited and that he would get one of those joobs and somehow the next day he told me that he wasen't getting it any more. After I going and play my first games I sorprise my self and the team to cause I was playing a really good level and we won the league that season. For next season I got a record that was not receiving any goals in 10 games and that lead me to win the best goalkeeper in that season. And you think others have more opportunitties to have success and you would not have any of them, and it only matter how fast you can learn and how good you do them.

One good example of it could be sports and I have had a time when something like that happened to me",0
"Once Generic_Name got the options to pick home school or to attend to normal classes. To pay attention during classes can be hard because of other classmates are making noise or it's really hard to understand. Activities after school are a good way to keep people out of trouble. She chose to do classes at home. Her mom told her that if she weren't pick to stay at home and doing distance learning; she weren't to feel that way. Some people can be in disagreement with public schools, but they have on mind that sometimes it can be a better option. To help them to choose a good path. If this person form part of a football team; he can get scholarships to participate in big leagues. They have the option to enjoy a team from their preference. People have the option to choose whith what they feel comfortable. From clubs students can get an idea of what career they want to get in the future, to discover new things, and to get experience from this different activities.

Other might argue that distance learning gives students time for their jobs, they can avoid being getting in trouble and they can take care of their youngest siblings while they are at home. Sometimes is great to have a person that we can tell everything. Schools offer different options that distance learning does not. Teachers talk about our grades and gives us advices to improve them. She was getting use to it. One day she realized that she has no friends; she feels alone. Generic_Name thought about what her mom told her and she decide that the best option was attend to normal classes at school. If students attend to regular schools they have the opportunity to meet new people, to participate at clubs and they have the chance to talk and get help from teachers.

Students who attend normal schools have the opportunity to meet new people. Attending to regular classes gives the opportunity to pick their own classes. Students wouldn't benefit from attending to classes at home. School it's a good way to get out of home for at least some hours. Generic_Name when to talk to her mom about the way she was feeling. Public schools have different kind of activities or clubs that they can enjoy. They might like to form part of the football team and that's what normal schools provides. School have a variety of ways to have fun, not just by playing, also by learning. She was happy for the idea that she has not to wake up early. Activities and clubs are a good way to help and to prepare students for the future. At school we can have fun with our friends, lunch time is unique and that is something the distance learning don't offer. Not everyone likes to be anti-social and to be alone without not knowing others. By going to school, we have the chance to talk to a thousand of people and to make new friends. If we attend to regular classes, we are not going to feel alone and we can make new friends.

Schools provides the chance to participate at clubs. For the first couple of weeks everything was fine. While distance learning don't have activities or clubs for students to do. Talking to teachers helps to understand because they give us a deeply explanation.

At school people have the chance to make new friends, to have the oppoortunity to try new activities and to improve academically with the help of teachers. For example, a person who like football. . It's a good opportunity to attend regular classes. Everyone can learn in different ways but a better option it's by attending normal classes. We can have many benefits by this. The awesome thing about normal schools is that teachers stay a little longer after school to help with hard work. Sometimes we need a push or help from others who knows about the things we don't. Not everyone likes to being at home for the whole day. However, people by attending to classes have the chance to get help from teachers. It's a reality that not everyone is capable to understand easily",0
"Students do some of their work but get off in a short period of time if they are at home, if they were at school the students would be on task and doing their assignments, unlike at home they would be off task.     . Many students prefer teachers teaching them so they can get more information of what they are being taught. The students who prefer distance learning really do it at home and feel like they are learning mush more at than in a classroom. Many people prefer learning in class with a teacher because they can ask questions if they don't get the question that is being asked. Classroom learning is beneficial for many students and teachers.

Students have their own way of learning, it doesn't matter if its distance learning nor in a classroom. Many people think this is a great idea and some oppose to this learning method. Students are more interactive with each other and sharing thoughts and many techniques to get the answers by fellow classmates, also getting good grades. Schools have brought distance learning in their system for students can do their assignments from home. All the students are in the same page and all gathering more information by writing notes and being concentrated in their tasks. Distance learning is a new learning method for students to attend classes from home by online or you can video conference. Students who enjoy learning in a classroom like being around peers and want knowledge from everyone around them. They are both beneficial for that specific student. Is distance learning beneficial for students at home? for some students it might be but for many it isn't.

Is online learning at home beneficial for students? some students do think its beneficial and a really great idea. Students are more productive and they share their thoughts and explanations in that specific assignment than online classroom. Students who don't do their assignments they wait until they are at school because in school you arn't distracted like at home you are concentrated and ready to work. The students who get on the computer and get on the online class for a short period of time at home might be playing, or might not be concentrated, because he is at home and dosen't feel like doing it. Distance learning isn't capable of doing what you do in a classroom. It is how they feel how they enjoy learning. The schools can see if they are on track or online to their classes but if they arn't in the online class they will be behind in their assignments. Is this new learning method a great way to learn? or does being in a class with a teacher more beneficial for the student?

The main problem in distance learning is if students are really getting on the online class. Is distance learning really beneficial?

Is being taught in a classroom more beneficial for students? many students prefer being taught by a teacher than online. Students who do get on are on task and on point. Students will say this is the best way for learning other no this is, it doesn't matter what you think is the best way to learn its how you enjoy learning something it is the best way for you",0
"Probably their parents doesn't want because they scared of how people are going to treat them or they are going to give them a bad influence like going in the wrong life. But i will say that people don't need to care what other people is saying to them.. If I have a choice to choose one of them i think i will choice to go to school to know more people.

These are my three reasons on how students can do the online classes from their home.

The first reason is why students want to do the online classes from their home, because maybe they don't like the people from outside probably they think that all people are bad, they are not nice, mean, in respectful. Students will benefit from being able to do the classes from home because maybe they have reason to do there or having some problems because some people doesn't like the community or having to many people around them. Or they don't want because her son/daughter are bad having some medical problems they think that the people are going to laugh at them.

The second reason is maybe other students don't like to a normal day of school they probably like to stay at home and taking the online classes from there, because they feel that people are not gonna like them or judging them sometime students don't want to go because maybe they have a medical problems because they feel embarresed or something bad happened when they were at school.

Finally if I choose one of them like staying at home or going to school i will choice to go to school because I will love to help people to explain them that why is important to go to school and giving a advice to them that they don't need to be embarresed if they have problems they just need yo let it go some people don't think if he or she are hurting the person who is bullying them.

In conclusion is that if people choose the online classes and doing at their home they are free to choose because they equal are going to study but at their home they have reason to do there",0
"Student's come to school on time and prepare to learn. If we didn't have two hours added to are day then it would be much easier to stay after school, And students would be waking up on time and going to school more often.

Next reason,Some students have jobs after school and responsivbles. Having a job is important some students could be going through tuff times like family issues,Some students even have kids to take care .Some students got a lot to handle that and school work and going to school. Having to go to school for four days would be great and all but I would rather go to school for that extra day then just four days for ten hours. That they would have to make up which could be hard because they would have to stay after for school if we would have ten hours of school and it would be hard to do it in class. Students even have time to work on there homework when they get out of school. These actives could affect students class work, How tired the students get and sore when they come back from school.

In conclusion, We shouldn't add two more hours to the school day for four days a week it could affect students attendents and how they act with others,People have jobs and responsivbles after school and students actives and homework. Other students they got other thing to do for example vist people family members,having chores to do around the house.

Now,My last reason would be students wouldn't have time to do homework and actives after school. They do want they have to do after school and everyone is happy with that,Others will be unhappy if we would add two more hours to are day.. Should Generic_School extended school day's by two hours for four day's a week? My opinion about this is we shouldn't let this happen for many reasons for example; Students would be waking up late,People got jobs after school and responsivbles after school, Students wouldn't have time to do homework and actives after school. That's why we should keep the school days nomal and how long we stay in school. If we would have added two more hours then we wouldn't have sport or staying after, It would probably be late and teachers don't want to stay longer then they should and parnets could get worryed about the kids for staying longer. If we would have ten hours of school it would be impossibe to take care of those thing. The student attendance would drop a lot, Students would be waking up later on in the day, And would be missing a lot of class work in the moring that could be important. There are alot of students who stay after for help with there homework, Clubs and sports,some students enjoying staying after and practicing to join the soccer team,foorball team etc. I'll give you more detail reasons about why we shouldn't let this happen.

My first reason, Students would be waking up late to school, It's very important to go to school and people waking up late could cause a lot of problems with the government and with parents. Other people would agree with me and my reason why we shouldn't let this happen",0
"And in the future maybe are a manager or on the future have a company and grow everyday. You had a good job were you will grow more and you not stay the same. If you want change your life for something more good, work, help, grow or look for something what can change your life. with the help of

Lord he in the only person who know our destination, and we will grow with help and our effort, we can accomplish everything.

When we do something productive we are growing. Because it only they do this they will never grow, the peoples needs helps to grow too, or we need do this with our self no body help us every times is for us depend is we one day change the luck. sometimes be had opportunity to grow but we lose it.

But for some reason people do not like when others people want help them because some times this not are good intention some times one people only want the other person don't grow. And we can guide other person, to are good employed and not want more the other. For example meet a very important job and if you had a good recommendation and if they give for you a job. Based with my experience, I agree with Emerson's statement. Some peoples are in the street because they do not think on there benefit.            . The job can help to much and pay to much money if we are good with the work and do everything how the boss want to everybody do.

Whenever, you want to do to grow not do more or want more then other or you not do nothing, not startle do more of the other, the people who want grow more then other for them never are something benefit or desire what other had that is not good. On this time nothing is the same the boys and girls only want go to the street and they smoking a lot they never are on the home, the mather and father are very bad, because they don't have idea were their children are. if the govern do anything for help those guys we can grow. Decently the author Ralph Waldo wrote, Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. With not problems in your had. But not every persons are the same some one really help other people only who had a lofty heart. And the children they never grow is they have already mastered, they will never grow.

What someone can do with this situation for help the children. its for this the author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ''Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow''. Because we can do something else for grow on the future for our family, it is important think what you will have in one time think for how many things we can have if we work hard. What we need to do is had a good job if we work hard we can grow more. Put everything in practice and you will had a good life",0
"On the other hand, this would make the technological integration in school even better and easier, something that many dream and believe will happen in the close future. This would make so that daily grades get better, but when test day arrives, the student who Googled every answer in the past week would get a bad grade because he didn't really learn anything, all his answers were based on someone or something helping him. Last year, a student in my classroom was caught using his cellphone during class. It would also be easier to cheat and get good grades, since all the information would be of easy access. Everyone has a cellphone so there would be no need for extra devices ,since phones have 1000 different uses, including many that could be of help during educational time.

The student from my classroom which was caught using his cellphone still uses it during class, he is barely passing that class and complains that the teacher is not explaining something correctly and that is why he has such low grades. By allowing the use of cellphones in class many students would get even more distracted than they already are. With limitations in place, like blocking certain apps and websites that have nothing to do with school, cellphones could be useful during educational time. He pointed out that the reasoning behind it was that he was searching something that involved the class, but the teacher still took up his phone. Cellular devices draw too much of teenager's attention and can also encourage cheating. This would then encourage cheating, because that student would most likely realize that with the use of his cellphone daily grades were getting better, but when it came down to not using the device his grades would drop.

However, it could be helpful and very easy to set up. With the integration of cellphones in class students would start getting better grades, since many of them would simply Google all of the answers for a worksheet instead of paying attention to the class and answering it based on what they've learned. Class is a place where students should focus and pay attention, by allowing the use of phones many would get distracted and use it for non-educational purposes which would make learning harder, since this focus should be used on what the teacher is saying instead of what their friends are posting online.

Secondly, it would be an encouragement to cheating. Many are addicted to social media, and have the ""need"" to check it every 10 minutes. Teenagers spend enough time of their day staring at screens, and school should be a place where that doesn't happen. I believe cellular devices should not be allowed during educational time.

Initially, cellphones would draw too much of student's attention. On the other hand they can be helpful in the right occasion. Sometimes when I am in class and decide to take out my phone, not looking and paying to the teacher for more than a minute makes me loose focus of class and need to ask the ones around me for help. But everyone knows the reason he is almost failing is because he'd rather stare at his cellphone screen instead of paying attention to the teacher. Technology integration in schools is already happening, many give chrome books to students so they can use it during class, but these are expensive and getting one for every student is not always viable. I strongly disagree with the use of cellphones during educational time and believe they would cause more harm than they would help.",0
"Should people make their own decisions, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters? People should make their own decisions because if you trust your decision there is no reason why you should ask someone else. When I saw my back yard full of leaves I ask to myself why did I make the decision of not cleaning the back yard. However, part of your decision needs to come from your heart.

Firstly, If you want to accomplish a dream in your life you need to put some extra work trying to get it done. What I do when I have to take a decision of doing something is to think the decision twice.

In conclusion, never give up a decision of you doing the right thing. Other people who you should talk to are your siblings. Always do what your parents says or ask you to do because they are the ones who wants you to accomplish your dreams, be there when they need you, talk to them when you need to. For example, lets say you are a soccer player and you have a game but you don't trust your team mates what is going to happen is that you might lose that game. The idea of going to school should be one of the most important things you should do.

Thirdly, asking for help in taking a decision is not a bad idea. Example, one day I made a bad decision of not cleaning the back yard of my house for like three months and it was fall and what happened was that it got full of leaves. Putting some trust on your decision can help you do what is right or wrong. Also, getting it done is not going to be easy but sometimes you need to try. For example, if you want to ask someone what you should do after graduation must come from you but sometimes you can ask questions to your family and talk about it, they might know what is the right thing you should do.

People agree with you taking your own decisions than doing what other says. I know is hard to trust someone who doesn't act or look the same as you. Ideas are part of what you should take seriously in your life. I would take my decision and ask my self should I trust them or not?

Secondly, trusting your team will not always be the same but you should follow your instincts. However, every day or every time you want to ask someone for help you must know who you are asking. Other unknown person's decision is what you should never do in your personal life.                                                                  . If you take wrong decisions will cause you things that you don't want",0
"There are multiple options that can occur.

Another reason this option is good is because you can hear all the others people's opinion's about your choice and you can mark out the ones you have already happened to you in a perfect or an awful way. Different people can give you different responses about your situation. Most likely if all the people you talk to about advice or help, you will pick what they have choose. Which can make your problem worse of the option your gonna have decide to pick which advice could outrun the rest. Hopefully you do talk to more than one person to make a better choice and give up the less opportunity cost. including the rest of your life, your mood for the rest of the day, the improvement, or the impact. Maybe even after picking your choice it could turn out the worst day of your life or the best. Your always gonna have a opportunity cost. You can learn from it and help other's or you can learn from it and help yourself in the future if you ever come upon the same situation. Which can be good or it could lead to a bad cause. You either make a good or a bad move, which can lead in different directions. Most people talk to more than one person to see their other options instead of putting all one decision into one person's own opinion.

One thing I like about talking to multiple people for advice is that they can give you so many open options to pick and decide from. You can also, pick their opinions or options and learn from it either if it's gonna be a bad time or a good time. But still can be able to help others in need. Even picking which choice your gonna make can put more stress and pressure on you. When you're looking for advice, you might not go to the same exact person. Or even teach the one's need in teaching

One dislike I don't like about talking to a couple of people for advice, is hearing their opinions and advice it could possibly change your mind of you were thinking about before, But also it could be the better choice of the 2 or more open options. It's really hard to make the selection of which advice your gonna pick.. After you have learned you can help out the one's in your same position or a little more different",0
"Thomas Jefferson wrote determine never to be idle, it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something, people can accomplish if we are always doing something, people can follow his purpose what they want because all people can done with want they accomplish in ours life its many things that can we do something.

First, People like to be idle with other people like in some works when they do not want to employed in his works just because they have a inability personal but if people want to accomplish.       . Also be a wonderful person in jobs like restaurant help to have more client but depend how the people serve. They can doing something like in his home or a thing easy that they can make, for follow living but some people something just think about what they want to make his purpose but they never do something.

Second, People can follow his purpose and doing something wonderful, but if they do not are idle for example in some works like that people who work. in some place the boss are idle and that do that people leave that job for his idle personality it is wonderful if people do something good for his life because, some people do things bad and that happen that in some place never proposed something.

Third, In some place or country are bad, because people do not accomplish to have a good country because they do not do something good, for example something steal person, and happen that country accomplish a purpose we need to accomplish what we can or what we what for ours life, and do not be idle because are idle do not help for make something better for ours life, so we need to have patience with want we accomplish.

We need to doing something good for examples, people that work in office need to be amiable with people that need something most of the people who work in office do not have to be idle. So first to all we accomplish more if we are always doing something for ours life and do not do bad things that do not help for what to accomplish so we need to think first the things and glide that things what we want to do",0
"going outdoors is actually more fun than staying indoors doing nothing, because you can do a lot of activities. Also when your going outdoors make sure to bring someone with you so you can do activities with them. I think that many people are avoiding going outside, because of cell phones. And if you have no one to do activities with head over to a local park to do activities with other people. Some activities you can do is play sports, practice sports, run laps, and do exercise. If you dont like to play sports, exercise, or run laps you can just ride your bike. People these days dont go outdoors as much as they used to. Riding your bike can actually help you later in life, because it can give you stronger bones and can improve your stamina and strength.

Another thing that you can do is play outdoor games, such as tag, freeze tag, and hide and go seek tag, but there is many more. Therefore i suggest that people, especially kids, to go outdoors more.. A good time to go outdoors is when its sunny and when you have nothing to do. These outdoor games can also improve your stamina and strength. There are people who stay indoors just listening to music, but you can actually go outside and do activities while listening to music. I think that some people find outdoor activities enjoyable, because they can do activities with others and enjoy the weather while doing activities.

People should go outdoors more, because if they dont go outdoors and dont do activities, there is a chance that later on in life they can have weak bones",0
"A person need to be establish our decision,and sociologist person. Every want to be like seek person in their life. So if we do hard work and study more, then every thing we want we can get it. In real life if someone do more pattient they can grow more and more, they can get their goals very easy. If some one want to have the good futur, job and famous person their live they have to be have a good defender behind them, or someone does't have some one to support them, then they have to support their self. So we have to care about our futur and family to suport them also and have great life. Finay a person should be a seek, bold, ect to make their decision and get their goal and have great live and futur. Every family should suport their child to studay hard and think about their futur life, and also if our family does't support us then we can't choes our decision and we can't grow.                                                                                                             . Other people say that people should not make their own decision .

People should make their their own decision because life is important other people can't choes my decision and my life, and every one has free dom, every thing they want they can make it for their future. Some people say that people should make their own decision. We have to be powerful person in our life. People can't make my decision. If some one is seeker in their life then they can get their goals easly. So if we don't have family suports then we have to support our self and choes our decision. No boday want to their life compare to some one eals. A person should listen other people idea and make their one futur. The person should receptive to admonition of their family because family always choes the good stuff for us, and never chiets",0
"""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you someone else is the greatest accomplishment.""-By Ralph Waldo Emerson. Being individuality people became to learn many things. Be individuality make people more believable in their selves and be positive in their own decisions.

In conclusion individuality make people be themselves and they can effort to be the greatest accomplishment. To be ourselves teach as how confront our mistakes and how to process them.

secondly, Be individual make people more believable in themselves. Some people try to accomplish themselves to demonstrate that they not need someone else to be successful. Some people effort to do their best and not be dependent for someone. Those people who believe in individuality became more independent. However, that is not true because be individual make's people to believe in themselves and also is the greatest accomplish to keep believing than what others' believe for us. Some people be individuality because they are more believable for themselves. Those people who are believable in themselves are people who truly want to be successful in their life because when people are individuality they do things for their own and they realize that they are not depending for someone.

In the other hand, some people argue that is not good idea to be individual. In addition for some people to be themselves is the most greatest accomplish because people learn how they can value for themselves and demonstrate that they can be something else without help of someone. For instance, ""When people make thing for themselves they believe in them and being positively."" Some people believe that is more better be individuality because they believe in what they do that what the others' do. For example, ""those people who decide to marry and separate from their actual family, during time they become learning to how survive with out help of their family and they willing that they can value for themselves."" Some people demonstrate that they are independents for their actions. Those people believe that be individual is a bad idea because they say that two person have more ideas than one. People do not need be with a partner to demonstrate that they can do many things for themselves.. Some people rather be individuality because they didn't like the opinion of others.

To begin with, People learn how they can be value for themselves. Some people believe that believe in themselves is more accomplishment than believe in another people",0
"One day we went swimming,everyone had fun except my cousin. To illustrate,if someone be so strike in live and doesn't wants to try something beyond what he/she already mastered,that person will have a hard live. In the whole,Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement was true based of the reasons.. Moreover,we should get out of our comfort zone so we could have an easy live.

Based on this argument,one must conclude,people never get better unless they try new things in live. For example,my biggest fear in live is airplanes and i never been on it,but if i try it for the first time in my live even i scare or not next time,i would have more confident for trying new thing since when the airplane was my biggest fear and i try it. The person will never grow in live since he/she scares to get out the comfort zone and try new thing. After condensing her for a long time,she try it. For instance,my cousin was always sad and she hated to try new things. Ralph Waldo Emerson says""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered,you will never grow.""On one hand,some people disagree with statement. On that time,my cousin was so happy that she even wants to be a swimmer now. Thus,people should try new things to make them feel good and happy.

Finally,it makes the live easy. I could do more. Further more, trying new things make our confident level high which is an important thing in our live.

In addition,it makes us feel good. Nevertheless,this opposition other important,namely that trying new things give us a high level of confident. People should try to do something beyond what they have already mastered since their confident level will grow,it makes them feel good,and make their live easier.

However,not everybody agree with position,some people claim that people can grow in live without trying something new because they don't want to get out of their comfort zone and try new things. On the other hand,some people agree with this statement",0
"the other reason is to meet other people so in that case i would have to travel on a day theres going to be a lot of people.

The reason I would go to France is to have the knowledge to be able to tell someone about how it changes you and how it's like and different temperature like how the country is to going to change on bad temperature their might just a small amount of people outside. If I could go any where in the world I would go to France. But the main reason i want to go to France is because of the thing to see their stuff like the ifle tower. Because a lot of people said that the food in France is delicious so I thought what if i try to get my own opinion. And the food there is amazing in France they also have a really good accent. Like chuwawas are so cute and the most known animals in France at lest that what i have seen on television. You also try to see if the people their nice or mean to other people.

If I ever had a choice to go to France I would say yes and when I get the first thing i would try is there food. France is also a beautiful place to visit with a wife or girlfriend to enjoy or relax with your loved ones. On a good day there is going to a people are walking around having fun. The reason I would go to France is because a lot of people said that

France was a romantic and beautiful place to go. To me it feels good to be apart of something it doesn't feel good to be the third wheel just staying back watching them give there feedback but have no clue what they'er talking about.

The animals in France are not that dangerous and the cats and dogs are exreamly cute. Most people in France like animals and chuwawas design which makes them look better.

I hope after reading this prompt you know more about France and it also persuade you to go visit France. I hoped you liked my prompt and enjoy reading it.",0
"They would not be able to participate.

If students finish high school early, they may not be able to take elective classes. Additionally, students have to do projects, and presentations. It's really exciting because all that hard work was worth it, and you made it, but to get through you had to give up many of the activities you liked as well as your time. Having to take all the classes they need, can barely fit into their schedules. All of these can stress students a lot, and won't have time for their own.

It's not a good idea for students to finish high school, and enter college or the workforce one year early. Students would not be able to take elective classes. Students must take classes during the summer. Finishing early can be very stressful for students.

Students finishing high school in three years must take classes during the summer or in the evenings. Instead, students would have to attend to school, do homework, study for tests, and quizzes. Students would need to take classes during the summer or in the evenings. That is why it's not a good idea for students to finish high school in three years, and enter college or the workforce one year early. Many students work over the summer, and having to take classes would not give them time to get a job. Imagine yourself getting out of high school early, and going to college or the workforce. Similarly, if students take classes in the evenings, and want to be enrolled in sports, or clubs, which require students to stay after school. Schools should not offer students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early.. Many students may not be able to take elective classes. In order for students to graduate, they have to take required classes. Students have to study for all of their classes, do homework at home, and keep up with their classwork, so they won't get behind. This would enable students to be enrolled in elective classes like art, drama, music, or photography.

Some people may say that students finishing high school in three years, and enter college or the workforce one year early, it's a good idea. However, it can be very stressful for students. Also, finishing one year early can be stressful for students. This required classes are also important when getting into a college",0

"Is honesty always the best policy?

An old proverb says honesty is the best policy. Another example is that if your friend ask you if she looks good in a certain outfit , however, that is not your style and you don't like it at all , the best thing to do is to say that you like the outfit, if you tell her this , you will not hurt your friend's feelings.

One more reason of why honesty is not always the best policy is that you or people around you might get in trouble. sometimes, however, honesty might get really bad effects.

honesty is a good characteristic , if the the situation is very serious or you and yours friends did something really bad , you need to be honest and speak the true, but sometimes honesty is not always the best policy because you might hurt someone's feelings or you and people around you might get in little troubles.

Honesty is not always the best policy because you might hurt someone's feelings.    . For example , If you and your sister ate something that your mom left in the fridge while saying "" I am going to work and when I come back , I will eat this."" when your mom arrives home, you tell her that you and your sister didn't heard when she say that she will eat it later on. This way , you and your sister will not get in trouble , however , you know that it was just a white lie and that if you do something serious the next time , you need to be honest and tell her the true.

In conclusion , honesty is not always the best policy because you might hurt someone's feelings or you and people around you might get in trouble, however, there are many situations in where you need to be honest and speak the true. For example ,one of Generic_Name's friends tells her something and ask Generic_Name to keep it a secret,

the next day someone is trying to persuade her to say her friend's secret out loud and she just reply by saying, "" what secret are you talking about? , my friend didn't tell me a secret or something like that."" she did the right thing by laying because if she would not lied about it ,

the friend that asked her to keep the secret would feel upset and nobody else is going to trust Generic_Name",0
"But if we are always working and don't spent time for ourselves or time with family then you could accomplish more but you will suffer a lot more for that successful.

For example, when we work hard and don't spent time for our self or we don't have any private time to relax and stop thinking about work, we will get stress and stress led to a lot of thing like can't sleep at night,depressed,or maybe can't eat well. That is why we have to have free time because we don't want to get stress and get tired of our work so it can led to quit job or we getting fired.

Another important thing is that we need to spent time well with our family too because family is where we have the most support from and also the reason why we work for so hard if we don't have time for our family then they will leave us and then, by that time we gonna work and live so hard because we are lonely. And we might suicide or getting depressed and lead us to drugs. m and go home at 11p. Some even said he only sleep 3 hours a day, and the consequence is he died at the age of 60 because of sickness and he even have autism when he stay awake for too long and talking to his own self. That is why during this summer his wife leave him, his daughter don't wanna see him anymore because he was never there for her, and his son just never call or visit him. Like another scientist that work hard like Thomas Edison, his name is Albert Einstein, he work really hard but don't manage time well so he have barely sleep a day. Family is what matter in our life and that is why we have to spent good time for them so they can be with us and support us when we need to so we can work harder for. m and he never have time for his family. We could see that why he is saying this because he is a hard working man and look at what he have done to the world, there is nothing wrong for working hard. Now he is 40 and he is a very success person but after all of that he is still and lonely old man. I have an uncle in Generic_City, he is a successful business man, he work for a well-known medical company and and owner of a market but to pay for what he own is his time for his family. This is why we need to spent time for our family because after we work so hard in our lives but we dont have family after that we are just lonely peoples that have no one to make our life happy til the rest of it.

i think Thomas Edison quote have nothing wrong with it, and it is true that human can do so more if they are not have idle time. So we definitely have to manage time well between work and time for yourself to maintain doing good work and have a good and healthy life. According to Thomas Jefferson: ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" What he wanna said is that if we are always working and never have free time we will accomplish so much more. He start work at 5 a. But if we don't have those idle time we will soon face with stress, disease, depressed, loneliness and also suicide, so why we work so hard and don't have free time so we die in miserable ways when we can work hard and play hard too and enjoy our life in a really good way.",0
"Many people think that if you're so expert and mastered you'll have a really good future , but some people think that the more time you're trying to do the think that you want you'll miss time on your life because the only thing that it's important to you is that think that you really want.

Some people try a lot a things but if they didn't get and they fail and some of they stop what they wanted ,but some of them keep trying and trying their best to get what they want, always try your best and don't give up, when your families or friends tell you that you will not grow more or nothings don't belief that because your're more strong that you know just keep doing and if you're a expert doing that thing you like you'll grow a lot because you have to demonstrate to the people that who you're what you can do. Trying new things helps you to understand that you can do more things,everything depends on you if you really wants to do something that you like, just do it , never do the opinions of others people because is only you, the people can't control you life everything. The thing that you already done and you was doing and everything was wrong,what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote is not right because doing something that you already done but you didn't get it that's doesn't mean that you life is done or you will never grow that's wrong, when you're sure that what you want you'll be fairing for that thing that you'll lose for many times but you'll be fairing for that and you'll not get tired until you get your dream.

My father is a singer and he's very strong and he really know what he want, one day he participated on one big project about music, he was a really good singer but on the day of the presentation he completely lose his voice, but he won the presentation trying he's best , when he won many people tall him that they wanna to do a big different projects with him ,and now he is a big star and he grow a lot, that;s means that if you try something you'll grow a lot because you have to belief and be very sure what you want and if see if you like, never give up just like me, when I came to United Estates I didn't speak any English and it was difficult to stay here and don't know any English all my homework and my project was difficult, but I didn't give up and i'm steel growing a lot and i have been trying a lot a things and I steel growing. steel faith for that and i'm not agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson is wrong just keep wronging and never stop everything depends on you.. When you try something that already you have do, and that thing didn't work, don't be worry about that because than more time your're trying to do it you will get more strong and have control by your self, always keep strong and keep the calm, and belief that you'll be a great person and all the doors will be open for you",0

"So I hope that I could influence a sort of butterfly effect starting with me inspiring someone to lose weight and that person inspiring someone else and so on and so on. If you have any insecurities than you know what is like to want to get rid of those insecurities. The reason was that losing weight would be better for health. The first big reason is to do it for my health. There are several more reasons I could list but those are my main and biggest reasons I want to lose weight. I have a saying it's ""when you help someone you help everyone"" an example for that saying would be if I helped someone want to lose weight they might feel the need to help other lose weight. Some overweight people find it difficult to walk or to do something simple because they are carrying all that extra weight on them. In fact i sometimes find it hard to do exercises in gym class that most people would find easy to do. I just plainly think that I would be better off losing weight because I would think better of my self.

In conclusion one thing I want to accomplish in life is lose weight. One thing I would like to accomplish is to lose weight for three big reasons. There are many heath risks when it comes to being over weight and thats one of the reasons I want to lose weight.

The second reason I want to lose weight is because I would like to inspire other people that are overweight to try and lose wight. My Third and final reason is that losing weight is just better for me in general it would boost my self esteem and help me be not so self conscious.

To better explain my first reason I will talk more about it. The second reason is that I want to inspire other people that might be overweight and give them hope that they can lose weight. If I lost weight that could encourage other people to lose weight as well because they can say to themselves a person who was were I am lost weight and I can do the same. One of my many insecurities is my weight and I think that if I got rid of that insecurities it would better my self conscious and make me think good about myself. Losing weight is the one thing I want to do in life and helping others is also something I love doing.. I want to lose weight because it's healthy,because I want to inspire people to do the same,and because I want to boost my self esteem. If I lose weight knowing that I lost weight not only helping myself but also others I would be proud of myself.

My third and final reason to lose weight is that it would be better for my self esteem and help me be not so self conscious. You see bad things can happen to you when you are overweight such things as diabetes that is a sickness that is a result of being overweight",0
"The students in a classroom will want to be outstanding students so they will trying the best they can and start to progressing to reach that goal. Successful person is someone who achieve goals in life and make dreams true. People who are preising for a good work will feel great and ready to start a new project to progress in life. People who have a success life can be because they haved teachers who praising they for doing outstanding school's project so, this inspirated they to try the best they can and be a successful person in their future. Students with a good self-steem and smartness will want to have a great future and the ambition to be a better student every day. Praising students help they to improve their skills and doing their best. Praising great students can help to other students to try to do a better job like that great student and be praising like they. Being a successful person in life require some essential things. Students feel great when someone is praising them so, this help they to feel better and happy. Students with a good self-steem will be doing a better job and will make true the things their love. However somepeople believe praising a student's work to build self-steem is a good idea nevertheless, I think the source of true self-steem is archievement because, praising students who did a great job will feel amazing and also, it helps to have a better self-steem and students will have the ambition to improve their skills and archieve something to their future.

Praising students who did a great job will feel amazing and also, it helps to have a better self-steem. Positive personalities become to a good self-steem also, this make a better environment. Students who are praising for a great job will help they to improve teir skills and do better jobs every day and become outstanding students.

In conclution, the source of true self-steem is archievement because when a great student is praising will have the ambition to improve every day more to become a better student. Praising students who did a great job will be benefitial for the entire classroom becoming a positive environment and making the students more active to do a better job to be praising like an outstanding student and this help they to progress and do things better.

students will have the ambition to improve their skills and archieve someting to their future. My suggestion is to start praising great students to make they and others to feel the ambition to be better every day and create a smart, competitive and happy environment.",0
"When they go to school the most common topic between every kid is about video games, and that can affect their lives because playing all the time won't help anyone to study for an important test,or doing their homework. Humanity always try to look forward for what is better for our lives and make everything more easier. While some people say this is a good thing, some people think it's bad for our lives because people stop interacting face-to-face in public, they don't want to get out of the place where technology is at, and some might have an agressive behaivor when they told them technology is bad for them.

In the past people always met in the street, there was no technology were with a single ring we can saw our friends into a little screen and talk to them. When we used to meet strangers in the street, we saw how they behave and what they're doing, and that's how people made friends in the past, saw how they act and behave,but now Internet is the key of making a friend that we don't know if it's real.

When we were kids it was all fun to play outside: in the streets,going to a friends house, or even going to the park with them, but now things have change a lot since we were those kids who played in the streets. Families have issues when their kids became agressive just because the prohibited the use of technology, and this reaction is trendy right now in different parts of the world. Now with the new technology people made video games, and now is the popular thing between kids and teenagers. All we have to do is to connect the device to the TV and just play, but some people play the whole day and they don't want to go outside to play any sport, or going to a friends house. Some doctors said that the reason why they react like that is because they are in an imaginary world where they can do whatever they want, until the parent try to take apart their""world"" to become a normal kid, but now that technology is in every single corner, it's hard to make a kid stop use technology. Now, this problem became a bad thing in our society, people don't go outside to meet friends, or just enjoy how the city looks, they prefer to stay at home and talk to people that they don't know who they are. Technology is an important thing in our lives at this moment and it will be more important in the future. Some of these people might say that there's no difference when they talk to a stranger online because we used to talk strangers in the street;however, there's a risk when you talk to this people online and it's the fact that some of them used fake accounts to hack personal information and other things. In the past when they created the first console it was a wonderful thing, but some kids didn't have the enough money to buy it, so instead of save money for a tiny console, they save money to eat something like an ice cream, a burguer, and go to attraction parks,but now we can see how the kids and the teenagers from now don't want to get out where technology is at.

Due to the amount of technology we have now develop, a new behaivor where if we prohibited them to use technology, they reach to the point where they become agressive. Even teenagers went to a ponit when they are playing video games they break everything they got on their sight, including the video game device that their parents bought for them.

Some people might say that technology is something positive in our live because we create artifacts that make our lives more simple;however, technology is bad in our lives because we stop acting like normal people and we want to make our lives more easy, and that can affect how our saciety can be in the future if we don't control the use of technology.",0
". Thats why you should consider to change the school menu do it for the children that goes to school so they can be healthy and learn new things every single day.

My last reason, is that the student won't be geting sick alot, and they will coming to school more often, they wont be missing alot of school day beause of the healthy food that they will be eating from our school every day, we will also be helping their parents because when their children get sick they spend alot of money for doctor and medicine, but since we will be giving healthy food to the children they wont be geting sick alot. I know that it wil be a big change, but it will help the students alot here in school, i have some reasons of why you must change the school menu and how it will help us.

The first reason is because the parents of the students won't have to be worry anymore of what thier children are eating in school, you know that there are some parents that want thier children to eat healthier, and if we change the menu they wont be worry all the time, because they will know that thier children are eating healthy food, every single day they wont be eating junk food.

My second reason is that the student will be heathy, and strong, they will also be more active, and ready to learn at school they wont be sleeping that much, and they wont be so lazy, because what the student are eating right now in school that is junk food it will make them, less active and their brain won't function good though the whole day. and we will be teaching them the importance of eating healthy food and being healthier.

This are my reason of why you should change the school menu so please consider this idea because we will be alot more healthier then what we are right now and our brain will functon good, and it will help us for the rest of our life, because in school is were we spend must of our time and we learn everything here, its like our second home do this for our future and for the good of the school. Dear ; Mr principal i have done some resarch, and i think that it's a good idea to change the school cafeteria menu, to a more healthier food",0
Also i like to have my personal bubble because i dont like when teacher or student come to my face and start asking me about stuff that i do not know or when they give me a attitude so that is the time when the situation will star to get worse because every time when the happen i will do the same to do them but mine it will be worse and sometime i cannot control myself. Because i dont like to bother people just to do it or try my best to guess in the answer.. And i cannot be a other type of person who i am not because i will be lying to myself and lying to the people around me just because i am acting different or look different for other people to think i am like that. sometime i like to with work with groups but is all depend what type of people am working with and also how is my mood during the day of in the class. Been around people is not my type stuff i like to do i just rather to be alone and do my own stuff but if need help would ask someone who i think they know just go to the internet and try to found what i need online. It is so ease if you respect me i will respect you back because if you come at mo where an start saying stuff to me and i really dont know what is going on i swear will disrespect you and say a lot stuff to you because you came to me saying stuff and every time that happen i really dont care if i hurt you or i hurt your feeling. when the work in a group i like to work with people that wont talk to much and we do our own work. Also if you think we are friends and you start to get conferees around me and you start talking about your life i am just going to walk away because i didnt ask you about your life because i am not interesting in your life because if i did i probably would ask you but if i didnt ask that mean i really dont care what do you do or what do you like. Or event class class if i am not talking with anyone the mean i dont want yall to talk to me or if i dont like the teacher i just keep my distance but if the teacher i dont like and she/he come at know where an start yelling at me i wont stay quiet and i will say stuff back to you because you just come to my face an start yelling at me for no reason so that is telling me that you got a problems with me and i didnt know at about it. If you leave me alone we probably we be cool and we wont have any issues with each other. I like to be my own personality because i know what i am doing and i am doing because i like it and when people told to stuff or me trying to be a different person just because they dont how i am or that way i dress or look. If i dont like you you better understand i wont be nice to you and i wont try to have a conversation with you. Because when i work in group who talk a lot i cannot focus on my work or they are just talking stupid stuff and trying to be funny there is when i get mad or when they trying to put me in there conversion that i do not care because if i am not talking to you or to the group that mean i am good and i do not need you or i dont need your opinion. Also when am in class i dont like when teachers or student start asking me question where i am from or what do i like to do. or sometime i like to work when the place is quiet because i can focus more and the place is quiet i can do my work in peaces. so just because i couldn open the exhibit window am going to write about what do you i like to do in class. I like to work alone with no body bother me . When am working like to listen to music because it let me to focus what am doing and i dont get distracted with the others student talking about drama or what is going on an there life or school,0
"seeking multiple ideas can be good because...

they can give you good ideas and you can see that people think different.

you will be able to have multiple choices to pick from and make the right decision.

you can even meet new people while your at it and also they can help you see it in another perspective.

Are you having a hard time deciding something? if you are you should talk to other people and see what they think its good to see what others think because, they can help you decide and give you great ideas,for example i had a friend and she would help me decide all the time and she would give out great ideas and i would pick the right decision with her help.

Also they can give you ideas and you can decide what is the best one and you can make the right decision and see what is the best idea and you can make the right decision not just that but you can see how others think and they might think different from how you think for example if you think that chocolate is better and your friend thinks strawberry is better then you should give a try and see if you made the right decision by picking strawberry instead of chocolate or she might be wrong and chocolate is better then strawberry but you will never know in till you try it.

Perhaps they can help you see things in another perspective,also you can make new friends while your at it,but not just that you can share your ideas as well and they can see what you think and help you out if your stuck and they will tell you if your doing something wrong and help you out and see it in another perspective,you might think that going to the movies is better and your friend might think that staying at home and watching a movie is better and she starts telling you why its better and you end up staying home and watching a movie because the reason she gave you where good.

You should give new things a try to because you will never know if its a good idea or not just ask your friends on what you should do during the weekend and they will help you and you will be able to try new things and take new ideas from that and its also nice to talk to someone and share ideas it will keep your mind off things and you wont be as stressed because you will have someone helping you.

those are the reason i think you should be seeking ideas not just from one person but from more and i think you should give it a try and see how it goes and hopefully it goes well because it works for me so give it a try hopefully i helped you see things in another perspective.       ",0
"I think older student should assist the younger students i think they would get a lot of work done. I would also like to be in this program it seems like you would know so many things. They would help the younger student a lot i feel like they would learn more.

Then in a few years later the younger student would come the older student and from there they help them as well too. I really think this program would be successful to all the student.. This program would be a great one it would there student a lot. Also the older student are more responsible there also likely to be more trust worthy. I also think they would be focus all the time. The student would get along easily if they work together. The program would be a success because student helping one another is great seeing them work together as a class having a good time with there class mates. I feel like older student would help the younger student improve there thinking by getting help from the older students.

I feel like the younger student would not be afraid to ask the older students for help. Do you think older student should assist younger student? i agree i think it would be a fantastic idea. It would help the class communicate to one another",0
"Since I saw my brothers actions and behavior towards my mom and saw it worked out well I did the same thing.

For instance, one day I heard my mom arguing with my dad on the phone because of some misunderstanding they had and my mom was using foul language to address her part of the side and my dad was using it too. the actions my brother took I followed them if though they were good or bad I got influenced by it. Also the way my mother was speaking and the language she was using towards my dad influenced me to speak back to her that way when she called me. Eventually, as I was leaving the store the manager called me up and asked me why I was giving food out and I told him that I saw my brother giving so I thought that was the right thing to do. In another occasion my brother and mom went to the toy store to buy some toys for a birthday present for my cousin and my brother really wanted this toy so and my mom said that she was not going to buy for him so he started kicking the floor because he was mad at my mom and because of that my mom bought him the toy.          . So later on in the day my mom called me on the phone and told me to go get my little brother at school and I told her it was not my problem to get him and then I started using foul language on the phone because I thought it was okay because she used on my dad. I believe example is not the main thing it is the only thing because younger people growing up look up to you by the way your behavior is and they hear the kind of language you use towards friends and adults.

For example, when I was growing up I looked up to my brother I watched his actions very closely. Many people can set a good example by the way the behave but you can also Influence people by the your professional career you have. One day I saw my brother giving food to poor people at 7 eleven and I was shocked, the next day I went to give food at 7 eleven. So the next day my mom took me to the supermarket with her and I really wanted this snack from the shelf and she said that I could not buy it so I started kicking the floor and crying therefore my mom bought me the snack. In another occasion I heard my brother giving out compliments to people on the street and by the way he spoke it influenced me to say the same thing as him as walked the streets.

Some people may argue that people get better influenced by a person of its professional career because they think they got to the place there at right now by showing they can go anywhere no matter what example they show.

In conclusion I believe that example is the one and only thing that influences others becasue what your actions do your younger sibling and friends are going to follow it and get influenced by you",0
"I can start my basketball practices, learn new skills, and be more active. So this is the good reason that schools should have three week summer breaks.

The second reason that schools should be year-round is because students can have longer winter breaks and celebrate the new year with their family. So government should start thinking about these issues and make schools year-round. Me and my friends always like to play soccer in spring because it is so fun and you can enjoy the weather while you playing soccer. Having shorter summer break can be beneficial for students to remember information. So having longer winter break can help most of the students to go to their country and celebrate the new year with their family.

The last reason that schools should be year-round is because students can get a week off in every season of the year. Also I will not forget any informatin that I learned in school in three weeks. For example, in three weeks I can go to beach with my parents and friends. For example I love to go out with my friends in spring because it's close to summer and weather is very nice to spend time with your friend. In addition I can rest and sleep more during the weeks off in each season, so I don't get tired and get bad grades in school.

In the end I agree with having year-round schools because students can have 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. . Although, some students enjoy having long summer breaks, but I think there should be year-round schools because students can have 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall.

I believe it is enough for students to have 3-4 week break in summer because long summer break can make students bored and forget all information that they already learned in school. For example, one of my friend loves winter break and he always wanted to go back to his country and celebrate the new year with his family but he never got chance to celebrate the new year with his family because he didn't have time because of school",0
"In the old days it is not money or success that makes you happy, it is memories from your past that bring a light, wrinkled smile on your face.

Memories are memories you can let them die but what will you do of your interest, interest never leave. What is the purpose of going to three year graduation if you don't get time to spend with your closest ones? One year is not a long time if you are in a productive environment and surrounded by positive people then why to go for three year graduation in high school ?

High school isn't just about graduating it is about making memories, spending time with friends and learning to socialize. In my opinion, one year of job experience and salary is not even close to the memories you have with your friends and the happiness you fell when you come to school.

In the nutshell, everyone of us know that college life is not so enjoyable and fun as school life. Everyone like to have fun, joke around with friends and skip the school for no reason. Human beings don't need much to be happy even a small success or a short class that gives them pleasure can have their face bloomed for the whole day.

More ever, high school teaches to take mature decision and have good manners. It may seen like a child play to most but those who miss this part, miss the most enjoyable days in their life. This four year of high school is the golden time for everyone as it gives the life long memories and a never ending satisfaction to each and every student who has attended high school.. Being around with people teaches us to behave accordingly. It is the place where most of the people struggle and get a better direction in their life. If you are scared of failure and not fulfilling your wishes never leave the electives, which you obviously miss if you go for three year graduation. Electives are not needed for graduation but graduation only doesn't serve a purpose. Everyone becomes a better person when they graduate from high school compared to what they were in their middle schools.

Being a high school student it is not wrong to dream for one year faster graduation for the sake of one year job experience and one year salary. High school is the time when everyone, even the most innocent start to get off their limits and it is when the fun begins. It is not that we get a extra decision making class or manner class in high school but being in high school itself teaches to take better decision. Even machines don't work perfectly after being used continuously for a long time. Is a year too costly to spend for the life long experience and knowledge? Of course not. Doesn't the same goes for humans? In fact, we need more break because we have a lot to do with friends and family. We hope to do so much but can't accomplish our wishes in the whole college year. Just listened that people started taking classes in summer for graduating in three years, Where are the breaks? Don't they need any break. It will always hunt you in your dreams. If you can't have a class that you enjoy because of three year graduation then, interest and wishes are worth giving an extra year and you also get so much with it. Having many friends and busy time schedule teaches us to tell 'no' sometimes. One extra year of high school can do more than ten more years in life. Some may think that three year high school saves a lot of time but trust me, it will be the thing that you will regret most in your old age",0
"I think that it is right that you do that rule in our school because if you do, it might help the students understand that it is really important that they have good grades.

This may help the students but not only them it might help the teachers to. Dear Principal,

I just want to let you know my opinion about not letting student who have less than a C in their grades participate in any of the activities. I think this because it will help the teacher because they will have more interest in teaching us the students because they will know that we may attention and not that we just play around in class. I think that this is important because I personally think that my grades are important to me and to my family. I think that yes you should do this rule that if you don't have more than a C you don't get to participate in any of the school activities that we have.

Sencerly, YOUR S. It will help the students because they will know that if they try hard to bring their grades up they will be able to participate in the activities.

So, I really think this will help us so that we may attention more to our grades",0
"Generic_Name has a plan on the future, but she need to think and she need to trust in herself to achieve the plan, and she said that she like working alone and she don not want have friends and she said that not needed help somebody more. For example: On boy is playful and don not pay attention on the class, but the boy take a decision of no more play, and the boy start study and he is so happy because he has a great qualification. To be yourself in a world is the greatest accomplishment because every person have a great dream to achieve on the life or every people take a great decision by to realize a great things.

First, every person have a great dream to achieve on the life. Another example: A teacher said at the students that working together buy one student take a decision not working together,

and the student that working alone he make a great job and the others not make nothing. Every people have the opportunity to realize the plan that they have to achieve the dream that they have. For example: A student have a plan to realize a job, but the student don not want to have friends by to finish the work. Every person have the opportunity to achieve their dream, and every people can try to make something else is the greatest accomplishment.

Second, every people take a great decision by to realize a great thing. . Another example: One boy is working in one project by the school, but the boy want to work alone, the boy said if he working with your partner never to finish the job. is better to be solitaire because you can achieve a lot beautiful things alone, and when you make everything you need to take your time and relax yourself. All people have the opportunity to take a great decision because every people thinking different, and have a different dream.

To conclude, every people take a great decision by to realize a great thing, every person have a great dream to achieve on the life, to be yourself in a world is the greatest accomplishment. Is better that the people to keep the trust themselves and trust their own decision, if a person love anything to make that person trust in yourself and that person is feeling better when he is alone",0
"I think that's a such enjoyable thing.

The Japanese foods are also famous. The Japanese market, the one place I want to go at most in my mind. I can't describe it, but I know there is a wonderful place in Japan where can eat a lot of things, and also can buy anything you want. And they all have their own special places. Although some countries are not as that big and not outstanding, but they must have some places that can grab people's attention. So, I know there is a country described like that. Japan, the one place in the world I would like to visit.

Whenever people mentioned this country, I believe that what they're thinking to are the scenes and foods over there. With this happy atmosphere, and walk slowly to find out the things you want to buy. Many little pinky leafs formed numerous soft and fluffy flowers. However, the such beautiful scenes in Japan is also the one thing that attracted me. During some special holidays, a bunch of people will came here and participate some small activities which only have at night. The blossom tree is the most beautiful image I have been wanted to see from Japan. In this world has many countries, some are big, some are small. Sometimes just bring your food outside and find a blossom tree, then sit under it, looking at the image while eating. And now, just imagine that when all leafs are falling off from the tree, that scene just looks like many butterflies are dancing in the sky. The nicest scene is not just that, but also when the night is coming. At this time, the laughing sounds is even louder than morning.

Japan, a such wonderful place, a place that I would like to visit.. Only this image is enough to grab all people's attention from the country. How warm is it. Everytime, you already can hear the laughing sounds even you're not step in",0
"I feel like people making their own decisions will be a lot better for that person. Until the time to make your own decision it will be even harder to make then the time you went for guidance. In my opinion making your own decision will be better then any expert ideas because it help yo in your life and what comes after every decision you make for better or worst.  . Then theres the problem that the reason that i went to seek guidance was because i couldn't make a decision for myself and now since I'm self reliant it will be hard for me to make my own decisions.

Now if i didn't go to the authorities and experts and made the decision for myself but it still ended up being bad outcome. That you yourself will fell behind and lose whatever chance that you had because you never made a decisions for yourself and thats problem some people have because they have been going to someone else to make your life decisions.

In conclusion to go somewhere to seek guidance isn't bad it's what comes out of it to help you if it turns out bad or good it will effect your decision making to be better and worst. Than i would never be able to go another person for guidance and ideas and i would most likely turn to myself. It still would have been a lot better for me so that i can use the experience of making my own decision to help make better one in the future.

Now if you go to the authorities and experts to seek guidance and it it come out great and now your life is going great. But seeking guidance is that bad either for someone to make their own decisions says to someone else that they know what they are doing and can build something great with how their working and planning for the future.

Although seeking guidance is the worst thing to do, i feel like people making decisions for themselves is better.

For example if i were to go to someone for guidance or for something more and they give me some sort of guidance or idea and it turn out bad for me",0
"               . Should people make there own decisions, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters? No people should not make there own decisions because sometime people need more opinions with thing they do. I feel like sometime it's better to get guidance from other people, like my parents or older siblings because they are older and have been through some of the thing I have gone through. Generic_Name did not know what to do because he always tries to solve all his problems by him selfGeneric_Name told him ""you need to tell his mom"" Generic_Name started thinking if he tells his mom it will get wars. Generic_Name was happy that he talked to his mom because he could not do it alone and he was happy that Generic_Name gave him that advise and he was happy that he mad a new friend. Generic_Name kept on thinking he can do it by him self and that Generic_Name will stop but he did not stop Generic_Name though he did not need no help, but he did so one day a kid his name wasGeneric_Name came up to Generic_Name and told him ""he need to talk to some one about this because he was getting bulled"". People though that he was ward because did every thing by him self and never talked to others he did not even talk to is mom. The next day Generic_Name wanted to take Generic_Name lunch money, Generic_Name was scared so he gave it to him and walked away people still did not do nothing about what was happening. She told Generic_Name she will come to the school and talk to the principal and we can end this so she came to the school and talked to Generic_Name's principal about it they called Generic_Name and Generic_Name so they can talk about this Generic_Name said ""he only did that because he wanted to be friends with Generic_Name and get help in class but did't know how"" so Generic_Name said "" sorry"" and they both became friends and Generic_Name even help Generic_Name with work. Sometimes things get hard in life and you are going to need help, we all as people need someone in life to help guide us through thing that may be bad. Some people will say it's your life do what you want, make your own decisions but it is not that easy. There is always going to be someone to go to for help even though people will say it's better to work by your self because you will not make any mistakes but we all make mistakes.

There was a kid named Generic_Name he was a smart kid he always got A and B in school Generic_Name really never talked to no one. One day a kid named Generic_Name went up to Generic_Name and started bushing him and every one was just watching and not doing anything about it. The next day he went to his mom and told her he was getting bulled his mom was not happy about that so she asked Generic_Name who is bullying you Generic_Name said "" a kid for school his name is Generic_Name"". Like if they want to watch a move they can ask others on what to watch and they can help you out. Generic_Name got mad and ran away and started crying he did not like what had happen Generic_Name did not want to tell the teacher because he though it was going to get wars so he just stayed quite. If you don't know what you want to be in life then you can think about things you like or get help from someone that you know that had that career",0
"Often times people mistaken for want they want to be versus what they don't want to do. The world is a big place to be in for people and they don't want to express themselves out in the world, so they try to be something else to fit in. This quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ""to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else the greatest accomplishment"". People don't want to express on who they are in the real world and hide themselves. People who are not achieving their goals they go to be something else because they don't have a goal, or they are not themselves.

People are trying to be something else in their life by being not themselves. People don't have to be something else as a greatest accomplishment. The majority of people who are something else are not happy for their decision because they are trying to hide their real self.

The majority of people are not being themselves in the world because they are not happy about themselves. People need to achieve their goals without someone telling what to do in their life. They hide it to become something slese in the world.                                         . People are not showing who they are out in the world.

Often times people don't like to see themselves because they haven't found themselves.

People are most likely to go out at be something than to follow their goals.

People don't have to be something else as a greatest accomplishment. They have to know if they if the goals right for them to achieve, People with goals often don't like their goals because the world wants them to be something else in their lives. This quote is not true because people are not achieving their goals, they are trying to be someone else, and they are not being about themselves. This quote is not true because people are not achieving their goals, they are trying to be someone else, and they are not being about themselves.

The're not achieving their goals if the the world wants them to do something. People are not being themselves in the world. People have tried being themselves but failed because they can't find themselves. People are not being themselves in the world. The majority of people will be something else rather than then be who they are inside of them",0
"And if he stays late to night to do it, he will not focus the next day. Requiring students to do that job is very difficult, especially during school days. And if the community needs some help as stated; take them in a specific day during school. But if it's everyday, community service jobs should be announced. So that will hurt the student from both ways. That way students have some time and also learn community service during school.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME. If he goes to do that service, he might not do all of his homework. 1-24-2011

Dear principle,

Community service should be a job, not for students to perform. Community service should be a job that the government should be giving to people who don't have jobs. Example, that of a person who comes back from school, tired and with a lot of homework to do. As my position was stated to you to read, my advice to you is; at least help some students get our of this difficult service. Students should have their time in school and after school to learn and enjoy part of their life",0
"I think he is also trying to say is that dont let anyone drag you down do what you think is right and dont let anyone tell you that your wrong try to prove them wrong because you can do anything. . Aesop said, No act of kindness,""no matter how small is ever wasted"" I think that what there trying to say is that no matter how mad you are or sad you can still find happiness or hope even if you lost someone in a family member it is ad but also just be a little happy that he is in a better place that he dose not have through any pain or suffering.

Aesop said, No act of kindness,""no matter how small is ever wasted"". I think what he is also trying to say is to be happy to have fun enjoy the little thing's as a kid once you become older your not going to have that much fun because were going to have to find a job, house, vehicle, and other stuff and it's not going to be fun so enjoy the little things and to have fun while you can. Maybe you can be wrong but learn from your mistakes and try again.

"This is a good intention from curfews, to protect them at the end the only beneficiaries are the teenagers.

For example if they are in the middle of the night they can get a trouble , because they going to do wherever they want when nobody is watching them, for other part if curfews say not they have to respect the rules .

Otherwise nobody are in the street playing or doing something good in the night, all people are in home resting or with their family doing other things, they have to apply the same for teenagers.

Also in the night someone can steal your properties, or doing something bad to someone or to you , why? to you because maybe you are watch what others are doing to someone, and you try to help or do something.

Some people thing that have fun in the night is good idea.  . but is not, for examples going to the clubs is not good in my opinion, because you don't not anybody ,or something can happen ,for example in Las Vegas almost 3 years ago someone shooting a club in the middle of the night many people die. In conclusion curfews have to take care of the teenagers this is good for them. Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble,or do they unfairly interfere young people's lives?

In my opinion yes curfews have to take care of them , it does matter if they are young, Also if they are in the night",0
"So they bring you from a failing grade to a passing grade.

Teachers and Students Volunteer to meet with those who either have difficulty in a certain subject or wanna finish there homework .

Why is it after school ? . The more you learn the easier it is to get in collage . If you get a good grade on mostly all your test then your gonna have good grades and thats a fact. Learning new stuff can make you twenty percent smarter than you usually are. Learning new stuff can get you a better job in the future.

There's always time to learn new stuff .

By going to a after school program you can study for quiz and test. Passing test can bring your grade from a F to a C+. quizzes are mini test so you should also try to pass them because both are huge deals. Passing quizzes can bring your grade from a F to a D+. The longer you stay the more you learn more . Finally , So they students can study for quiz and test and pass the quiz and test. Collage looks at people who learn a lot so the after school program is gonna make them have a better future. Fist, the student will have more knowledge. Learn more and youll have a better career.

When you get tough new stuff it can be fun to learn about the new stuff your learning about . The reasons i would argue for students and teachers having a after school program. So when you learn new stuff you can be ahead of your class. There's more reasons but those are my reasons.

When you go to school you learn. Second , When students are in private with teachers the teachers will teach them new stuff",0
"Also, showing that you are interest in the job and showing that you want is good to show. I would make it a priority to make sure it gets done.

In conclusion, I think I would be a great person to hire. I will show the kind of respect to my parents, to anyone else out there, whether is be my boss, coworkers, students, or their parents. That's why I think it's always right to be in the best attitude you could possibly be in no matter what you are going on outside of work.

The amount of responsibilities I will receive is no match for me. You are probably thinking, ""Generic_Name, everyone can be a well rounded person in their own ways"". Referring back to what I said about lack of respect, an example of that can be: coming to work and being in a grumpy mood and telling people mean things can get you to lose your job. Another thing is, grading homework and making sure they get it back. Speaking 2 languages is great. Being respectful will show others that you are serious about getting the job. You want to be able to show people that you are qualified for it.

Respect is another thing I will always have with me. I could demonstrate that in many ways. Thing is, people can't compare themselves to me. Seeing and meeting people will improve my knowledge and how to work with others. I would stay after school with them for as long as they need until they understand and can accomplish what they didn't get in the beginning. Hi, my name is Generic_Name. I will get a be able things once, maybe twice, in my lifetime. Giving me orders is another thing that i would follow, even if I don't want to do it. If I had a chance to work with kindergartners, the ones that struggle and are not comprehending what is being taught. I heard that you are accepting people to come look at some businesses they prefer, and learn more about what they are interested in. I will always go out of my way in trying to help kids understand the material they need. In other words, If you hand me 2 stacks of paper and give me 2 days to fill it out, I will. One thing I'm interested in knowing is, How many people do you let come and experience this opportunity ? I strongly feel like it would be a pleasure to be able to come and see the environment or being able to understand the right and wrong ways of teaching kids. I think I would be great for this position because I am a well rounded person, very respectful, and responsible.

I feel like being a well rounded person is a good character trait everyone should have. For example, if I have a Spanish student in my class, I'd be able to have a conversation with him and make him/her feel comfortable. I

have qualities that others may lack in, such as: speaking 2 languages, understanding kids, and being about to tolerate the kids. I think I would be great for this position because I am a well rounded person, very respectful, and responsible. I feel like most teachers lack in making sure they grade their students test and not returning it on time. This experience will make me a better person. . Showing lack of respect can kick you out of your job",0
"When you have free time that's when you can text call but not in class because if you do then we won't know how to do the work and we would get a bad grade.

So when it's after school lunch or your free time you can use a phone but when your in class you need to turn it off because your teacher is trying to teach you something. I would pick policy 1 because lunch is free time to eat talk to your friends and to use the restroom. Who wants to pass i know i do because i want to get a good job because if you don.t pass your classes then you can't get a good job.. So when your in class no phones when your out of class you can text make a phone call take pictures of friends. If u need to tell your mom something you can text her or call her but when your in class and u want to text someone you will miss the work and you won't know how to do the activity because your texting. When your in class every day you know something new about something, someone, somewhere",0
"For the electives the students would probably have to switch them out with core classes. Students would have to take extra classes, which means more work. Students could also have the choice of taking the work over the summer right after school goes on break. Their reason could want to move on to college after those three years. There are teens in high school that want to join the work force at a young age.

The three year program has a lot of good benefits for students, but its not an easy thing to do. The reasons high school students would want to do this is to reach their career early or they have personal matters that make them want to leave early. Have you ever thought about finishing high school early? Not every student wants to finish school in four years. High schools that have this program are giving students a huge benefit. For highschool teens who do this program would have no time to slack off and would have to work had achieve their goal of finishing in three year.

In the three year program you are given choices on how you would like to do youre work. Another reason to why students want to finish is because they could have problems at their school. High school has bullying and other issues that could leave them with no choice but to want to take the three year program. To some teens going through with the program could be a difficult task. it is a good idea for teen s that are taking a three year program to advance quicker to their future goals.. It is a good idea for teens to take the three year program, because they are trying to accomplish their goals early.

Not all teens want to spend all four years of high school. There are schools that could let you take the program through online. This would mean students will have to take extra math, science, history, and english classes",0
"The disadvantages of doing such a thing to school are, Schools are reducing school hours, teachers won't be getting a salary instead they will get pay hourly, and the economic is going to be low.

I believe that, school days shouldn't be reduce ,just because they want to save energy. That means that those people need a secondary job so they can support themselves

Finally, the economic will increase because businesses are reducing peoples hours just because they want to save up energy. it is a good idea to reduce the energy that we consume but in away it's also affecting our economic and learning system.. People have debts to pay like credit cards, health/car insurance etc. To being with, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of then hours. Students must be at school for eight hours. The pay checks will be reduce to hours worked during the week just like any other job that pays by hour. Schools are planing to do two hours of school each week. Food cost will highly increase its price.

In conclusion, employers shouldn't reduce peoples hours. Otherwise the teachers won't have the time to give the given material. Students studies will get interrupted if they get two hours of school weekly.

Second reason, is that teachers won't be getting a salary for two hours of work",0
", Another example is my cousing , he want to be a doctor but high school is not easay fo him because every morning hi has to take him brother to middle school in class should be star the same time to other school he not going to lost a semester in the year too in him is going to be a dortor who his mother after died tell him .My mother she get sickly for three months she make a decition , continue to going to the university in work was not a big deal for her do two things on the same time but her work was hurt because she finished almost eleven forty nine every day she not eat good , she was not doing homework months after lost her baby lost a semester with two weeks everything is going to be perfect is the hours of college was normal ,

Secondly 80% of students not do homework in they get a big problem for example Generic_Name how come to school because he want to be a good person on life now he is learning english we have a big different when you dont not a language because he het bullyng for other students in school because he dont speak english, when the principal know what's going ,he deside a new decition the class should be long , for one semester but junior get alot bullyng he deside one day died he write a note in say thaaks for your help principal but i can do this any more he died if the boss of the school be stop the bullyng a speak with the other students junior now should be here .Another example is PROPER_NAME was a normal girl one days the office send a mesagge , we are change many things this week for example we dont have school on mondays but right now we have school on saturdays a problem now was she has to walk every day to go the school in on saturday in the night we cant walk to late on the stree because she has to work after that one night she was tired to walk every day in she stop in a corner five minutes letter see four boys when she walk close around the boys they abuse her for boys if you think that s going to happen in your life you get mad because in the rules not changes every school college is going to be fine .

"another reason i do not agree is cause this generation prefers technology over human contact so its easy to see why they dont go their own path but instead they prefer to just follow the crowd and not follow what they want its mind blowing how we gotta take an sol too just to see if you smart when all you can do is just sit in a class and listen to a student and see how smart they are without a dummy boy test but im just a young student whos following the crowd just to get a diploma even tho at this point a diploma will barley take you far but it looks good on resume so thats why i am doing this exact test to follow the crowd of dead students just trying to graduate for a family that dont even care if im dead or alive as long as i got a diploma . Its a little creepy in all honesty but its the world we live in where people just wanna fit in and act normal to seek comfort and approval from someone else even when they dont need. Ralph Waldo Emerson believe that ""to be yourself in a world that constantly trying to make you something else you not is the greater accomplishment."" personally i disagree only cause now a days most young adults, child, and teens prefer to be around the same individuals who act, talk and basically does everything the same exact way",0
"Sometimes people only listen to they're point of view. Their are questions to make sure your not basis. To express thoughts and feelings they might have. But searching what needs to be done. Your able to relay on others and they're way of thinking. Because sometimes needs to be revised.

Trust other peoples opinion and look over them. Finally they do a self checklist and make correction. Hep you make good decisions. Fourth help them improve structures of the idea. Having a argument is a way of dealing with people. Arguments make you talk and reason with people. Finding the better response.

Determining the right course of action. Why seek peoples opinions? Learning to relay on different informational sources. A source of information you can reflect a pond. In order for you understand what they feel.

The best way to judge a persons idea. Third give more negative and positive feedback on the idea. Not guessing what you want to do. It's good for listening to other thoughts.

The important of not being basis. Not basis is examine both sides. On they're thoughts and possibly they're feelings. The proper thinking process for doing the action. Do planing step by step thinking. Arguments aren't always bad. Why is this idea more important than others? Does have depth? Is the idea understandable and matter? Is true or false? Theses kinds of questions are needed. A time of opinions matter.. Asks questions like. It's good to listen to peoples thoughts and reaction. You might agree or disagree and whine about a subject. First you need to look what they're idea is. Give destructive criticism to improve they're ideas. Searching for information with one source won't help you. They are on one sided scale and basis. These general stragaries people use to check a persons thinking. Second give destructive criticism on what it lacks and needs. Listening to peoples knowledge on they're point of view. People use techniques to make good decisions. Because people want to make a good expression",0
Paper is the best way to get your work and plan it out because they are your opinions and computer it changes the words to what it wants to change it to. you will need to do more work then just taring in the paper and not on the computer. The end you will have to have everything done by the do date you have in school then you will do the rest of more work you have to get it done just do it.. First need to plan your work and need to be organized and have good details about what you need to read and need to wright. Always need to wright your work what happens if you brake your computer but you have it on paper so your teacher can just grade your paper. Like to best teachers told me Generic_Name and Generic_Name if you wright something on paper you will always be right or in the right path to do good on your book. After always finish you weighting dont leave it have way done just finish it to get done with the work you have to do because if you dont you will have to do way more work then what you have to get done just do your work on time. Late you always need to be organized. Then if its organized you can use the same paper for next time but change some words or change the whole paper. All what you have in your head just wright it all on paper first or then wh en your weighting your book or story you will have everything in copy and can read it to make sure its good. Next you need to be organized if your organized you can read your work fast and so can the teachers if your work is neater your can do it faster because you read it and if you don't have time to finish pages in your computer you can tarn the paper but not on the computer thing,0

"Receiving advice from more than one person is beneficial and it can help you come up with your on decision on what advice is good for you.. First getting more than one advice from someone help's them make a better decision because they know what advice they need and what they don't need. When you get the advice's from those people they want you keep it so you can use it in future. When you get advice from more than one person it's usually something your good at. When those people talk about the same advice you have heard before it all connects together to make a big advice. Getting advice from more than one person can help you really think about the advice's people gave and you can benefit from the one's you understand. When you get advice it's to motivate your self to do more. You can get advice from anyone but you have to understand the advice that will benefit you.

When you receive multiple advice's you can combine all their advice's to get one big advice that summarizes all the advice's you were given. The big advice you get from all the people that gave you advice's is to either improve or be successful.

I think getting advice from multiple people can help you make a great decision. Second receiving advice from more than one can make you combine all of the advice's together to make one big advice.

While getting advice from one person is great, Receiving advice from more than one person is beneficial. Getting advice from more than one person is more profitable than getting it from only one person. Second you can a lot of advice from more than one person but you combine all the advice's you got into one big advice. When you get advice from someone it connects to things such as, School, Sports, Jobs,and many more. First getting more than one advice can help know what advice is useful and what advice is not useful. Do you think getting advice from more that one person help you make a better decision? Yes I think getting advice from more than one person help's you make a better decision",0

You can even miss a verb if your not careful enough. Anything can hurt your grade by being small things to big things including miss spelling.

Bad verbs can be everywhere including movies and books to scripts that's why people have to be extra careful typing. if you want to keep making your parents proud and get rewards too. An old adverb can hurt someone no matter if it's through songs,books or movies. spelling. reading and pronouncing a word.

That's why you have to be extra careful and read the sentence over and over again till you know it's correct and to see if its all good. so thats the good thing about it to keep a higher grade . It can hurt us in any way and the adverbs matter a lot of your typing and use the wrong verb.

It can bring down your grade but you can practice everyday to get better at writing and know your verbs.

Depending on the verb if its right or wrong if its wrong your grade goes down lets say if you have a 96 on a test and the verb is bad.

It will go down to a 94 if its more then the lower your grade goes and if its right you have no problems with typing. if you do it good enough you might be looking at a grade thats would be higher than a c but if you dont at least a c or a d and it couldnt be bad.

"A lot of employees dont work hard for the job that they have, if they dont work hard, that makes the company or the rest of workers look bad because he doesn't want to do anything. I'm always trying to able to do all the work and to help the others if they don't know how to do it. I don't like to many works to be doing at the same time, so I try to finish one per day so later on I wont have to come and start to do the same work I was supposed to finish the day before. If I want to go out and be with friends, the first thing that I tell them is that I have to finish my work if I have time to go out after work then I will be able to go with them, but if Im not done then I cant go, because the job is the first thing that we all should have in mind, then the second thing are friends, free time, all that kind of stuffs.

Second, I'm a hard worker in any job, because I like to demonstrate that I can do the best and any job at anytime. I'm a responsible guy, who likes to be able to help the others if they need help in anything. A lot of people tells me that I should get this kind of job, because I dont like when people are irresponsible and since I'm a responsible worker the rest of employers will like how I work, then they will start to their work just like I'm doing mine. Like I said I like to work hard, to finish everything by the same day. So if you need that type of employee I think I'm the right person, because I will work very hard to finish the job by one day. That's what I'm trying to change in this job.

"If you try to find something productive to do it will help you in the future. Now that im 17 years old i keep myself busy by doing school work or working my part time job, which wont cause a negative effect on me because im preparing myself for my future and life goals.

Overall students think that doing nothing is the way to go, but other students say that keeping themselves occupied leads them to a succeful and positve life.

Now a days i can tell that teenagers that have been getting into legal trouble really dont have anything to do outside of school.                            . which means you are more likely to procasanate. But staying occupied is the way to go if you wanna be successful and achieve things in life. To be productive or to do something productive really does'nt have to be school work related it can be anything like having a job, chores or helping around the community.

Lets say you have home work but you dont feel like doing it, because your used to not doing anything and or are lazy to do it. Sitting around and doing nothing wont lead you to anything sucessful in life.

If your at home sitting around having nothing to do will not help you to be successful. On the other hand if your used to doing your work the same day its assigned and or turn it in on time you are less likely to procasanate because you are used to staying occupied and doing all your work.

From my own expierence, when i was 14-15 years old i wouldnt do anything at home or at school which caused me to do negative things that didnt lead me to achieve my goals at that moment. While other teenagers actually do outdoor and indoor activtiy to keep themselves out of trouble. Students may say inactivity is the way to go, However other student say keeping yourself occupied will lead you towards achievement",0
"She always practical how to read in English and write English. Another example, it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing lead successful for example,Bill Gate who always doing somethings he was the first person to create Microsoft.

Bill Gate like always like do somethings with computer. He always advisory worker in order for you to successful always do somethings new. He was successful because he always like to do somethings

Bill Gate was rich man on the whole world today because he always do somethings build computer. Another example I wasn't good at Algebra at all I was fail the class also Got F on classwork and test to

I decide to stay after with teacher start practical math question I understand little by little but the first take my math test able pass test got B on the test my first every to got B on math. Never stop trying something new in life it will turn out be more successful then you never to be expected.  . This that It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you gain experience. I use thought that wasn't at my math class but always do somethings in my class able to gain experience in class. Always doing something you can learned from it for example I did not know how to cook anythings any time put dish on fire never come out good but when always keep cook it start to turnout good I was able accomplish always something new with my dish.

Finally it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something because can lead successful and you gain experience. The first my brother do his internship how to construction wasn't good at all but he was also keep doing it instill he was able accomplish it now he know to how to fix roof and many more things he is expert construction build. This show that it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something because can lead successful

It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you gain experience. This show that is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned.

Another example It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned . She was able to accomplish that because she always somethings with English leaned how speak English. This show that it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something. Although some might argue that, it is better to does inactivity also serve a purpose they are wrongs. Having you wonder why people able to accomplish so much just in few days? Today society people always works so much they miss out their opportunity in life. Although some might argue that, it is better to does inactivity also serve a purpose, actually it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something because can lead successful and you gain experience.

It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something can lead to successful. This show that

It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you gain experience.

The other side claim that it is better to does inactivity also serve a purpose, because you can be more wise about around you however it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned for example, when my mom came to American she did not know how to speak English. For example,My uncle when my came to united States he always do somethings with his hand such as construction and fix people car my uncle always doing somethings new if thous wasn't good them but tried able to accomplish them as such files tax for people he was able accomplish them.

My uncle now files tax people get pay a lots;

when people do not know how files tax they came to him files for them by that he was successful because he accomplish more if always doing somethings now he has own company where people work for him. for example, my brother who was doing somethings he able to accomplish more things. Thomas Jefferson say it is always good do something",0
"In my experience I don't disagree, that Emerson thing that mastered will never get him grow.

First reason, all people get mastered and that stop them to grow in something that they tried to do,For example if you are doing like your own job, and you are the manager you will see all the product that you are selling is going down, and you job it's not going well, of curse, you will be in unless to try sell other product and your stored that will happened to you and you stored that you will fell terrible and you will you not valuable to continue in you job because you are so tager to see that you job is going down not going up.

Second reason, Mastered is like you are in favor of something and your friend fight to tell you that you are round with what are you trying to do, After your friend try to tell you that you was so round you undated that you was round, them you tried to do the thing right but, you are you get in mastered and that make you to not have other change to tried again, everyone are unless to try something that they already mastered and, something for example you are teenager and you are is school and you did a test and you get bad scored of curse you feel so bad and you will no tried to retake your test again that having mastered .

Third reason, being scared to try again something that you love and that you thing if you try again that will be a same way that you did the first time, but went you try again, you will have more experience because you will try to not get the same mistake that you got first time, and will have to look so careful to not get the same mistake because you have more experiences.  . we all can do the thing many time the thing is that you have to believe in you,

and you will look that you will grow not matter how hart and, how many time you get upset, you have to be positive and to be screed if already have mastered.

Conclusion,It's that you never give up at what are tried, not matter how many time or change you take you feel that you get in mastered you always will have other change to start and trust that you can believe that you can do it because that's all that you need to start again",0
"Because i really like and also thirst for be a nurse and i think nurse can help a lot of people.

First, i usually learn some knowledge about nurse in books or online. This is a rare chance for me and i have plenty of time during the summer brake.. What a mighty job it is!

In conclusion, i hope i can get this opportunity, this hospital have high opinion in VA, and there's more projects that can makes me learn. There's some books that people write their experience about how could they become a nurse, how the nurse job looks like and also some story that they have met. As i said, i have read a story that makes me shake: Once in a night, the nurse was ready to finish her work, but suddenly, a man run in to the hospital and there's blood in his arm, he said somebody want to hurt him, that nurse keep him in to the restroom and called 911 first, she try her best to bind up his arm, she wrote in the book"" I'm so scary and my hand was shaking, but soon i clam down, i know i'm the hope for him"". Actually i know, it's a hard job to learn, even my first language is not English, it become harder. Sometimes, i also go to find some volunteers about nurse, it always help me learn a lot that i can't learn from the book.

Second, i think to be a nurse is arrogant. This story makes me have different understanding about nurse, this job can even save people's life. People always say "" Nurse is just like an angle"", they help people from disease. But when i see the story, see the interesting experiment, i'm fascinated. I'm very interested in the nurse and now there's an opportunity that school tell us to strive for an internship in this hospital, i'm very glad to attend this competition",0

"Then, you ask your dad and your sister. People's opinion will help you make a good decision.

Getting opinion will always helpful for you, if you know how to use it correctly.

Listen to people's opinion and then make your own decision. Now, you are a billionaire with many different opinion. But, sometime people don't always choose the better one for you. Getting better idea will help for writing an essay.

Getting more opinion can also help you have more choices to choose from. You can make your own decision.

But, asking for opinion from people around you will help you a lot. Next time, try to ask or talk to more people. So, you have to decide which option you want to take. You can use it however you want. Imagine a time when you were writing an essay. You continues to ask for opinion from people around you.  . You will decide you want to ""spend"" it or keep it for another time, like you are holding your own little world.

You will get more choices to choose from by asking people around you.

Talk to people for their opinion can help you make good decision. You try to asked one of your friend, but still don't have an answer for it. You don't know what college should you go to? Ask your parent, they will know what good for you. Now, you have three opinion from different people. You can combine those opinion together to make it a better idea. If you were in the middle of the situation, and struggle with making decision. But why getting more opinion is helpful for you? Getting multiple opinion can help you get a better idea, more choices to choose from, and help you make a good decision.

Asking for opinion can help you get a better idea. But that didn't enough for your essay. But you don't have to always follow people's opinion. You ask your mom to give you her opinion",0
"I think what you can take summer school for to finished the school in three years is a good idea because you can leave to school in start working or doing other somethings how example you can get a good job and make good money or you can start work for to help in the hause like your mom, father, and making money for buy something for yourself like a car, clothes, and the another rason.

If the student have 17 or 18 years old he can leave the school and not when they have 22 years old like the hispanic because they coming with 15 or 16 years old and the school put they in grade nine and if you graduate in only three years is better for you, becuase they going to was 18 years old and they already for to work in learned more english but that not is the same case for American People.

With the work force for to finish the school in one year early, I think that is hard but is so good for students with 18,19,20 years old because they can finish early in lirobic time in one year.

If you're hispanic that's not better choice for you, because you can't learn more english and that's going to be hard for you when you start work, but that not is the samein the case with American People because the english not is a problem with they and if they have the same years old they can get a good job and leave the school in lirobic time.

That's what i think about the finish the school in three and not four years and the work force for to finish the school in one year early, If the school give me the oportunity choice I say ''I want to finish the school in three years'' because is better for me for my years old .",0
"The reason I said it's taught me to be better is because I experienced a customer who was being really racists, although I didn't want to be respectful and I wanted to lash out I thought to myself that I needed to be the grown person and just try my best to ignore their comments and keep going on with my day because having a negative attitude can result to deeper problems and the outcome wouldn't have been the best. Remaining positive is really the key to accomplishing your goals.

I used to be the type of person who wouldn't really have a good attitude because I was usually afraid of what people would say or I would fear that they would disrespect me because I wouldn't have my guard up. The reasons why they would want someone who has a good attitude is because they have to interact with people, set an example for future employers, and also to satisfy the customers. I used to work at Chipotle and having that job taught me to have patience and also maintain a good attitude towards other people, even if they didn't deserve to be treated good. For some jobs you really have to face hard obstacles and it could get tiring and you would just want to give up but people should always remember that all the hard work you're doing now will be worth it in the end and they would be able to see their accomplishments.

Finally, I think school is the hardest place to remain positive because it brings so much stress to certain people that they don't know how to cope with it. I usually tend to give up when my classes get too stressful for me and I end up failing my class, I try my best to think of the good outcome it will bring me but sometimes I just feel like giving up because I don't think I will be someone big in the world and that is the worst mindset someone can have because as humans we all make mistakes but we should always think that we can better ourselves, if we only think negative then our situations may end up worse. Although at jobs sometimes it can be hard to remain positive because of the situations some customers or even coworkers put you in but I personally think sometimes as individuals we need to put out pride aside and be the bigger person and resolve the issues or just walk away without adding more problems. As an example right now I don't think I did good on this essay but i'm going to be thinking that I tried my best and if anything I could always try again until I get it right.

In conclusion as individuals we should always remain positive and keep trying our best because in the end it will all be worth it, even if it takes days, months, or even years. Most importantly, I need to prove to myself that if I continue being positive then I will graduate and I will accomplish my goals all because I had a positive attitude rather than a negative attitude and bringing myself down. The best way for you to remain positive is to remind yourself the reason why you are doing it and to show appreciation to those who never gave up on you even when you gave up on yourself. Personally I think that having a good attitude can take you far in life. I try my best to a good role model with positive intentions because I know my younger siblings are looking up to me and I don't want to be the person who fails them.

Most jobs would require for you to have a positive attitude because of the way their industry may work. My mom is the person who's always told me to treat others the same way you would like to be treated and ever since i've always kept that in mind and tried my best to remain positive. Many people have positive attitudes because it can have a good outcome in the long run and help them in their future. I know sometimes all someone does is think negative and it can put them in a really low place in life but they should always know to never give up. Over the years I learned to manage a good attitude no matter what the situation may be because you never know what someone may be going through and you wouldn't want to treat them even worse than what they are going through. A positive attitude is the key to success in life because it can lead you to having a good job, being well respected by others, having others look up to you, and you should never give up on yourself. To be successful in life you have to keep trying until you get it right and you acknowledge those situations and you have the mindset that you can really accomplish thing if you put your mind and attitude first.. I think that I need to remain positive so I can prove to those who doubted me wrong and I can show them that I am capable of doing good even without their help because in the end the only person you truly have is yourself. If your boss were to see what a good worker you are and they see how you manage certain situations they could even give you a raise because they can see the dedication you have for the job. I personally expierence this because I am not the best in school and sometimes I just ask myself

""what is the point of doing all this?"". Sometimes life can get too stressful and there's no positive thinking involved but I really hope that everyone can think positive in certain situations and that they can continue to live happily and see that every obstacle they went through will be worth it",0

Working in a group is more productive and easier it gets the job done quicker then you expect. You can have your own ideas without others forcing you to change it up into something they all like. There could be teachers who wouldnt support the idea of working in groups. Some students could be left back and behind from class so they would need the help from his classmates. There can be minor things when working in groups. The idea of working with other students would be much more easier and productive. What would make feel much better in class to work alone or in groups? Would it make you feel better and more productive? Some people think that working in groups helps them be more productive and helps them get the job done easier. Being alone isn't very helpful when you need the help you do.

Working in groups would not just help students but teachers on grading your work. One of each classmate can work in drawing, writing, searching up facts about the assignment and not least but last the leader to put everything together and help his classmates when needed. It would feel way better for you and other classmates. But not every student would support that idea of working alone. There is supporting ideas on why it would be so much better in groups and it would be to get the job done easier and faster. When it comes to mistakes you can point them out yourself and correct them. It can be stressful for them when it comes to working alone and having so much papers to grade. You could expect some who would do there job and just take advantage of time and not be productive. There could be problems too like not having enough time and can't get your job done as quick as you need it to be. Instead of stressing about who is not working and who can't get the job done you can work on your own. Like Having more time in the assignment and not rushing into it. Instead they would like for you to work alone to get your job done easier.          . The leader is expected to get there classmates to work and not waste time.

When working alone instead of in groups there can be advantages. There is other classes to worry about.

Some teachers wouldn't support the idea of working i groups",0
"Is enjoyable for everyone because you can do all sort of fun activities. One way I like spending my time is playing soccer with all my friends we gather around to play every day almost and some time we like to do competition in group seven to play who get the most goals and then we let the girls play when we finish playing girls and then we compare and the teams with more goal wins a prize same for the girls who is better of course we another match with the boy to double the prize then the match start for the boys for about hours is lot entertaining and fun you sweat, laugh,

"Some activities should be necessary to do in group.

For example, when they are doing a project. Each of every students can catch a mistake. Dear Teachers,

Date: 03/12/19

Address:

Center St Generic_City

In my opinion working in group should be more benefits.

Teacher should let student work in group.

Teacher should be allow students to work in group. However, most of the classses have workshit to do in group.

For example, make experiment in a lab, present in front of the class.

Some students say that work in group is more funny than being alone.

Sometimes, teacher don't like to put student in group becasue they observe that when student are in group they just talk about anothers thnig not about what they tell you , but not all the students like that.

In conclusion,

for these reasons is more benefits to work and group than work alone.

Sincerely,

Generic_Name. It would benefits to get more information about what topic they will do it.

Firstly, you can look more than one idea. There are three reason why should they let student work in group:

Working in group think more stronger and faster. Secondly, each students can make one question about what they are doing. Also, in some schooler teacher let student to work in group because some students don't feel comfortable to do the work by themselves. Thirdly, if you work in group you can be more comfortable with your work.

Your working should have the best idea and should not be any mistake because before to give the work to the teacher every students should look at it.

It would be more interesting to meet another students and know what they can do it, and if you can help in something that they don't it",0
"Also failure helps people become better people. leaning from there failure.

Although some people think incorrectly that failure do not play a role in success it should be know that it dose play a role in success, because you can lean from your failure, failure makes you stronger, and failure makes you a better person. people should not give up when they fail, they should learn and try again until they succeed. A lot of times failure may cause people stress, and stress makes people strong and not give up. Former British Minister Winston Churchill once said that 'success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. when people fail they can find out what went wrong instead of giving up, Another reason is failure makes people stronger. Failure is actually good, because it teaches you what was wrong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    . Many people are not perfect and fail, and some think failure is bad. Although some people may think that failure does not play a role in success, it should be known that failure dose play a role in success.

One of the reason failure plays a role is that people can learn from their mistake",0

"In my country the weather it is hot and I am adapted to my country's weather not to cold weather.

Another reason is that when winter comes and it snows sometimes the roads are too slippery some students drive during the snow days if they work during winter season they might have an accident due to the weather. I truly believe that a longer summer vacation can be beneficial for those students that want to work and save money when winter comes.

One reason why summer vacation should be remain long is that when school ends some students choose to work on summer vacation to save as much money as they can, so they can stay in their house when winter comes. If they have only 3-4 week of break they will not be able to save money when winter comes. I recently learned that some educators feel like the summer break is to long and that the students do not retain information as easily when they return to fall some people argue that there should be year-round schools. If they work during the summer they will nothave to work during winter days.

However, some students will argue that is better a shorter summer break than a longer break,

a longer summer break can be helpful to do a lot of things such as, work or relax.

Thank you for considering my opinion on this matter if you have any questions let me know and I will happy to talk about this matter.

Sencerely,

Generic_Name                                              . where there would be 3-4 week break in the summer a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall. Having to work during winter is difficult for those students that do not like winter. In instance when I started to work I did not like to work in winter days. In my opinion summer vacation should remain longer",0
"A other reason would be is that many students don't do their homework nowdays so it was just be a waste time for the teachers unless they are getting paid extra for staying after school now thats a differnt story. Do pranets know about this club would they let their childiren stay after schook is a way for them to get home if anyone can't pick the student up?? Would this homework club interfir with any other after school clubs or what if students already do a club and they need help with homework but they can't go to the homework club because they have to go to the club they do. I think that they should not do a homework club because what if students don't got time for that. Would any teachers parpicate in the homework club, do they know that teachers would argee on doing this club? How long would this homework club be a hour or 30 minutes at what would it end because students have stuff to do out of school. In conlusion i think that they should not do the homework club.. A other reason is what if none of the students stayed after school the school would have to be sure if students would a tend this homework club. Does the whole school want to do this or just some students cause not this club would be worthless. Students should be able to do thier homework on there own to be honest so that way they learn more cause maybe the teacher might be giving the students the answers and that's just not right! My other reason why they shouldn't do the homework club is what if most teachers don't give out homework like i don't get a lot of homework but maybe somone else wouldn't get homework",0
"Working with group is more beneficial because, if a person work in group then he/she can share thought and ideas before start working. Also, it helps student to learn how to communicate with other team member because team work is very important and necessary to learn before students start working professionally.

I believe that working in group will gives student more ideas and everyone in group can share their thoughts with each other. Communication is the key of working in group because, group working is also helps students to learn how to communicate and how people should behave when they work as a team.

Team work and communication is very important to learn before a person go to college or before start working professionally because, if a person does not have ability to work in team then it would be very hard to adjust in college or professional work environment.   . For instance, working in group gives more ideas from different people's sense of humor and people get chance to work with different people whose thoughts and working style is different. There are many advantages of working in group for instance, student can plan and share ideas with their group, they can discuss the work with each other before the start work on any project and they can also help each other if any of the group member is confused in anything. Group working is also save time because everyone work together rather then only one person has burden to complete all work.

To conclude, I just want to mention that I understand that working alone is more beneficial for some people but, working in group is much better more easier than working alone. It also helps students to finish their work on time and the most important is that not only one person have burden to do all work. The most important part of the any project or any other work is finish on time and if not then no matter how much hard work the person put is just useless",0
"This shows that courage can praise someone to keep going.

Finally, many young teens should trust what adults say to them and not ignore them. For example, I was not confident on passing the SOL and my teacher was praising me to be positive and not to over think it. People will want a friend to cheer them up and encourage them not to quit and to keep fighting. From the courage that is given to them then they will keep running till the finish line. Which I didnt listen to her and we got caught by the workers and they called our parents to come pay for the belongings we stole. This is saying that people should believe in their self more than what other people say about them that will drag them down. This shows that having courage, confident, and trust can help with self-esteem.. Also to listen to people that are there for others no matter what. Like a good friend once said ""never let anyone put you down always get right back up on your feet"". When taking any kind of test people will want to be successful. People end up giving up and saying in their head I lost there is no way to catch up because Im all ready in last place. My mother told me not to hang out with other teens that will cause trouble. This shows that by praise from adults, teens will make good choices that wont get them punished.

In conclusion, praises can be very helpful for a person to feel good about their self. For example, when I was younger I steal from stores with a couple of friends. True self-esteem dose come from praising someone to keep going and to follow their dream. However, some may say that teens can do what ever they want, they are wrong because teens need to be taught life lessons. People need to have thick skin to block all the negative haters and disbelievers because having courage, confident, and trust can help with self-esteem.

First, people need to be confident in their self in order to fallow what they want to achieve in life. This show that when someone praises another person that they will have confidants in their self.

Second, courage can be helpful in over coming fears that can drag one self down. To when having to play in a sport people will want to win and not quit. Then it came to the SOL, and when I finished it, the next day my teacher told me that I had passed. For example, when running a relay race and you start to fall behind. She later then told me that I should believe in my self more",0
"First impressions will always change bceuase you dont know the persons true color's yet. Finally, first impressions going to change because some people just act to do good on thier first impression.

For example, people dress and act good at there job interview. When they finally get that job, first impression is going to change because they are going to keep calling off and not work hard enough as they said in the interview. On the first day of school teacher's act to nice but, later on in the school year the teahcer's first impression is going to change.

For example, when you first meet the person they act so friendly and so nice until you really get to know them, they start changing. After that, the teacher's start getting tough on you and giving you more assignments. A lot of people act so nice on there job interview, but later on that first impression is going to change. Finally, when the manager see's that you changed your first impression you will get fired.

For example, on the first day of school teacher's act so nice and tell you how the year i going to go. finally, its a proven fact that teacher's change thier first impression.

In conclusion, I agree that first impressions change because its a proven fact and anybody in this world can tell you first impressions change because you dont know there true colors.. you will see the persons true colors if they act the same and do what they first did when you met them",0
"Pay no attention to those who don't accept you for being nothing but yourself, and don't change for them unless you're doing it for you. You shouldn't have to be the opposite of who you are just so you don't get judged on. You shouldn't have to please others only because they don't like who you are as an individual. You won't have to be someone you're not. You should always please yourself no matter what.

Lastly like Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" That writing is nothing but the absolute truth. You can have many accomplishments throughout your life.

The first reason as to why I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson is because, when it comes to jobs it can be real tough for some people. Some think otherwise because the believe that it would make life more simple and easy. Being yourself can benefit you as a person, people can perhaps like even love the real you. It can take you places you can't even imagine. Some job's ask who you really are as a person, once you let them know they don't like the response. You won't have to meet some jobs perspectives. But, there are some job's that will accept you and will like who you are truly.

Second of all don't have to be someone you're not. . Your individuality can bring you so much success. People could admire you and accept you even more.

In conclusion I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson because it is best to be you own individual self than not, because you won't meet jobs perspectives, be someone you're not, and also it comes with amazing accomplishments. Also you might find that being your own individual self gets you no where. You can become a role model to those who are having trouble on deciding if they should be themselves or be what this world want's them to be. I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson, it is best to be yourself than to be someone you're not. Some might even say that its for the best when in reality it isn't",0
"For other way, students need to have some rest of all. Students, teachers, and others employees have responsibilities in their houses and others places after school. Consequently, with four-day school and extending for two hours students can get more stress, and their grade can go down. Schools should not follow this model by extending the school two hours.

For instant, extending schools for two hours and four-day school, students can have three days free. Students will feel like they can not do it, and their grade will go down. For example, some of them have sports, drama classes, and jobs. Also, fathers can get a bad attitude about why theirs kids need to be ten hours at the school. Students can have more free time, they can hangout more with their friends, and they can have more rest. Schools should not follow this model by extending the school two hours.

First, some fathers believe that extending the school by two hours their kids will get more stressed.    . Many people thinks that the school should not follow this model by extending the school two hours. Schools should not follow this model by extending school for two hours.

Extending school for two hours, will cause that fathers will get a bad attitude, and some students will lost their jobs, sport practice, etc. Therefore, schools should not follow this model by extending school two hours. Therefore, schools should not follow this model by extending the schools by two hours.

Second, some students have responsibilities after school. Extending the school for two hours can cause that these students can lost their jobs or some hours, they can not go to drama classes, and can not go the their sports practices. Students can feel like they can not do all of the work what the teacher give to them. For example, extending the school by two hours students will need to do more homework, test, and projects. A lot fathers doesn't have a good transportation for can pick up their kids at the school that late",0
"When dealing with abdicating an idea from thin air, it be best to have multiple people instant of one because it brings multiple ideas all have fair and different point rather than multiple ideas no opposition or diversity.

Another benefit of having multiple people working in one group is that this can cause an evolutionary like phenomenon with multiple, stronger idea that complete and mulute, creating one in tribute and exceptional idea. Working in a team is advantage over some others who are unaccustomed to doing so , it helps develop people skill decision making skills and general expertise for putting up with others.

working in a group is also good for getting other people's opinion on group member work, as long as they do their part, oftentimes students will learn and experience more in a group of their peers than working alone which is definitely better for their future an possibly what lies ahead. Being in group full of adult and unfocused group members is infuriating and may seem like torture. Also being in a group fell safe. Now working in a group does not have its advantage but some things are best done alone

Though working in a group can seem to be good working alone can be better depending on the situation. Even though students are not agree with each other all the time, working together is ore beneficial than working alone.

Every body ha heard someone in their life say "" two minds are better than one"" before right, this quote has never range more, and all of the idea it promotes reflect crystal clear off of group work. Working in team also prepares students for future careers and job. New idea create diversity is the way to success.. Having a group of people can become extremely helpful for solving a problem that may come up in situations where a problem can arise, having a group of people can allow for quick and easy way to get out of a situation. Whoever they will be required to learn to cope with other people and personalities, it is valued by employers. Because it cuts down on how much work one person has to do. paranoia worry about other preference, or simply because they would prefer to work alone. Although, some people prefer working alone because they can focus better and make decision faster, in the end, it is a better to working in a group.

if one does not do work the only they fail. Working in a group can be drastically reduce the amount of work you need to do as well as make thing of more efferent, whether it be a group project paperer presentation. This also comes with the help of a group, as a group can decide which idea would be main idea and smoothe out the edyes.

Another problem that can come up is well problem. It allows for group to achieve more as alone. Developing these skill will most likely help in the coming times of college, careers their future family and even retirement.

Overall, working together is beneficial because it creates less work and allow work to be completed faster. Working together promotes constructive criticism from other member of the group , which produces a better final product, working together create different points of view with different points of view new ideas are generated. Student and teachers are have opposing views on working together for various reasons. While being alone means you are much more impotent so working in group

Though working alone can be better for one reason such as anxiety. However, according to new Stanford research, when people are treated as partners working together their motivation, student are able to communicate with each other, therefore creating a better final product. The diversity found within a group of people is one of most powerful resources a person can have when it comes to finishing a task.

it lends a group of people to have many more ideas to come up with and bounce off of because many people are working

""The best way to have good idea is to have a lot of the a quote from Linus Pauting dealing with dilemma new idea's. Things are also finished much quicker because of the way many people can split up different jobs in a group an people with different skill sets can do what they are best at and do not have to worry about what they are bad at, this broader range of skill can also be used to help other people members develop their own by learning from their team members",0
"The other day she told me that coming to school for five days is stressful because, she has to pay for gas and she is not working everyday like she just too, so her parents have to pay the gas for her .They told her if she do not start to pay for her own gas they where going to take the car away from her, I told her about how some businesses have adopted just going four- days to work for ten hours and I told her that our school should have four-day school week too, I think that would be a good idea and she thinks that is a great idea too, because she gets to saved money and gas and she do not have to worry about paying a lot of money for gas anymore and her parents would not be mad at her anymore because she would have the money to pay for gas.

Other example can be my Spanish teacher she lives a little far from school and she has to drive to school, but she is having some problems and she does not have enough money to pay for her gas. I ask her why does not she compete with the other kids like she used to, she told me because she has a lot of test's coming up and she needs to study and that she wish that we have more time in school so she can get everything done the same day because now she has to take her homework to her house and finished over there, now she does not get time to relax and chill like she always did.

Third, some students can ask their teacher for more help. I think our school should add two hours more and we should come four-day school weeks like some businesses they work for ten hours and they only work four days it can benefits students and teachers because, some students can have more time to do their homework, some teachers and students can saved more gas and money, and some students can ask their teacher for more help.

First,students and teachers saved more gas and money. Other example, my friend Generic_Name sometimes his teacher talk so fast that he can understand what she is saying, he want it to stay after school so she could explain him again, but he could not stay because needed to go soccer practice he being missing a lot of day because he always stay after school with a teacher for extra help and if he does not start going to soccer practice again, his coach is going to kick him out of the team, he is the only one that has been missing a lot of days, and he needs to get back in track because his team has a really important game coming up, so he can not stay after school for help anymore.

Some students think that they get stress for being in school for a lot of time;however, they are wrong because some students think that if they go to school for a lot of time they would get more time to do their homework.

Some students and teachers get to saved more money and gas, some student can have more time to do their homework, and some students can ask their teacher for more help this are some benefits of why should my school adopt a four-day school week.. For example, myself sometimes in my math or chemistry class we talk about something new and it takes almost the hold class and my teachers give us a lot of homework so I think the if we go school for ten hours it would be great because I would have a lot of time to do all my homework or I would have time to study too and I would just get home to relax and I would not get stress because I already did my homework.

Other example can be my best friend Generic_Name, she is taking all AP classes, and she gets a lot of homework sometime she does not get the enough time to finish her homework in class and when she gets home she has to take cared of her little sister, so she does not have time to finish her homework at home or sometimes she has projects do the next day but she does not have enough time finish in class. Generic_Name said that she gets really stress about all her homework and how she has to do it in so little time, she thinks if we go to school for more time she would have a lot of time to do her homework and she would just go home and take care of her little sister, she should not have to be stress about doing her homework.

Another example can be my friend Generic_Name, she loves to do homework because she likes to compete with other students, but ladle she has being so worry and angry about everything. Like myself the other day in math class we were talking about a new topic it was so hard that I did not understand the topic. ""Oh my God Generic_Name,"" I did not have enough time to finish my power point, me too Generic_Name said. My teacher explain me again and show me how to do it again but I did not get it, she told me the if we have more time in school hours it would be better because would take her time and explain us how to the work more slow, but we only have like one hour in her class so we do not get enough time ask a lot of questions. She told me that if she do not get the money to pay her gas she was going to be absent for some day into she get the money to buy gas for her car, that make me so sad because she is my favorite teacher, she is like a mom to me, and she would not be able to come to school just because she dont have enough money to pay her gas. After the teacher show us how to do it, I was asking for help every three seconds because I did not understand, after she explain me for the hundred time I was still confused, before the class end she gave us homework I did not how to do the homework ether, so I stay after with her so she could it explain me again, but the after school time is only for fifteen minutes. For example, my friend needs to drive herself to school everyday and she needs to pay for her gas. My friend told her about what I said and she things its a great statement because she would have more time to grade students homework ad would have more time to spent with her family.

Second, students can have more time to do their homework",0
"A lot people have a happy life just because they have to do something they like. Present. And then she begin thinking ""I have money, I have house, I have car but way I am unhappy"" Generic_Name go to consult her mother. Everyone have only one life. She choose to spend time for flower farm. She can sell some flower and get some money. And other day she make the flower farm and she feel happy. You might think the rich people is happy. she don't work in the TOYOTA company anymore. And then between vacation she see the flower farm. Because they just work for money not for happy.

"nI really loved that activity because you learn more and become good at it.

Another activity that can be fun and cool and enjoyable is playing an insturment. and its nice to play an insrument because you have alot of oppsions to choose from and you even get to play nice soothing music or loud and extreame. It is fun because i used to play an insturment the last three years and it was fun because you get to go to trips. These activitys should be done because they are very fun.

An activity can be fun is like playing a sport their are alot of sports out there that can be fun and aggresive but its exciting to play a sport because you get to go on trips and you get to verse other teams or with only one player. We went with the orchestra class, band, and even chores. Me and my science class will be doing it this year i am happy to do it becaue i never mixed chemicals or never put on science goggles. you get to even become a professional player

I played soccer for about two years and now i am good at it. And the fun part is that you get to be in a stage with your friends and play music infront of the audiance.

Another enjoyable activity is chemistry its fun because you get to mix different chemicals to objects or chemical to chemical. Last year me and my friends went to Generic_City. i cant wait to do it this year we will be doing chemisry in april. They can be fun because you get to do alot of things with them. it was fun. Mixing chemicals can be hard and scary because what happens if you mix the chemcals and something happens in chemistry you have to be very careful with what chemicals are you mixing together.

I am very happy because you have thosands or hundres of activitys to choose from because their are alot of people who are loking for a good and fun activity. Before in elemantary school i used to be bad at it and used to say ""im bad at this"" or ill say ""im not good at it"" but then i entered in a summer soccer program every evening or in the day i would go to a school and we would go to a soccer field. In this new year that we are now there are thosands of enjoyable and educational activitys. so i recommend you to go look for an activity that fits yoou right and that enjoyable and educational.",0
"Some people can't be honest sometimes and that's okay because not everybody is the same, we all are different. Because you are just letting go what you think and you want to help them on whatever it was, So that's why I agree being honest is a good thing!. Be honest with the people you trust or see them hurt an any type of way, help them feel happy, grateful, they will appreciate it alot, seeing that you stood up for them, that you helped them do something succesful. It's good to be honest to your parents because they have always been there for you. trust me they will be greatful. You never know what could happen if you lie an any case. And if they get it, they will like that you were being honest with them. If they are not honest with me than that's totally fine, I'm not going to force them on being honest with me. Like I said I will like to be honest with others so they can know how I feel about stuff or how I feel in my own way. If you don't, then don't push your self, If you don't want to be honest and hurt somebodys feelings is okay, it all happens. But don't just go to others and say how you feel about them because that is just really disrespectful. I will say I like honesty because I don't like when people are not honest with me, so that's why I like to be honest with them. Honesty is good, It might help others think good, different in a way, but smart. I could disagree but I won't because people need respect and I'll show them that I can be honest with anybody. But we still have to be respecful to others and all treat them the same. Be honest with your friends, they are like siblings to you, they won't judge. you are being productive. Aproving to this is good, why? why because people will like to be honest to, and they need to learn how to do it. I know how people feel when they tell a lie and I don't feel comfortable with it, at all. I'm not trying to be mean if i'm honest, I'm just letting it go how I feel. Honesty is a good policy because you are being strong, even thought honesty can hurt some people. People will appreciate it alot if you help someone close to them, they'll see you are one of a kind! Just be honest with people and if they might hurt others feelings, try to say it in a nice way, don't be mean to them. But in the other hand I will have to agree being honest is a good thing to do. I also feel that you are being responsible,mature enough to tell the truth. They need to let go of shy, and be confident, agree with yourself if you will like to be honest",0
"I'm agree because your first impression it will be the one that represent who you are and it will show your personality, and the people will judge you becauseyour aparience and your actitude, for example, when i was looking for a jod at chipotles restaurant for the first time, they where looking at me strange like i was a bad person or a criminal.

The next day i went to popeye's restaurant with different type of clothes, and they didn't look at me in a strange way, and that was because i was dressing properly, and because my friend tell me to dress better because in the first time when i went to chipotle i was dressing as a bad guy and that make me look inapropiate and i did get the job.

After that i went to chipotle restaruant just for fun to prove if my friend was right and he was, the people from chipotle didn't look at me in a strange way as the first time, i think it's because they didn't remember me but when the manager comes he said, ""hoo hellow you're back,"" then he leave.

The manager was the only person who remembers me and he did not change his opinion about me, i didn't care because by that time i did get the job at popeyes so i decide to leave out of there.

In conclution that day i learn that the first impresion metter and it could affect in your life.",0
". I think the students not have benefit from being able to attent classes from home.

First, the students has more distraction in home; with vedeo play, and othe oction, more students work a time with taking a class, more with have a classes in distance, the schools need a tanking a other options. The parents thinks exactly whit me, because is most effective taking the classes in the schools, in not a distance the schols. With lern in school the students are more specific learn, with a have a teacher opposite the student to learnig more specific, when she tanking the classes to has a more effective for a students.

Second, I hink this option for learning offer the class in distance wich a attend classes from home; not is a good option for example: in my house a have three brothers, and one sister, I think is distraction wich learning in home.

In finally; with reason with not is good idea the learning a distance the school, I think is more elementary, basic to taking the video conferencing online, because; learning more in the watch the vedeo conference, with online; is more effective memorize with the morning in not in evening, the students have forceful in the morning, but no think this is a good option for a students, not have a good benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

Conclucion; the students not taking the classes from the house or distance learning, but students learning more when she go to the schools. In my opinion, the students tanking to attend classes from home, by way of oline or video conferencing",0
"Testing online can be easy to cheat if the teacher is not around walking and watching what your doing.     . But I think it can benefit sometimes it can be a amazing idea for students to study home because they won't drop out of school. Knowing that student's can succeed in different ways is not bad even so they will be expected to have any sort of education someday in the future. School is providing knowledge for those who pay attention to school and more. Students would not meet each other or talk physically which would be awkward, can cause them to not trust each other if it comes to a project that needs to be done. Believing you can do what you always dreamed of is a motivation that will help learn more about life and the way it works. If students were to study from home it would be difficult for them to understand what the assignment that is being asked to complete at certain time. Students might not know many things but cheating and being sneaky are the two most known words we understand very well.

In other words there are advantages to studying online, disadvantages online and it would be a big disappointment for students to fail almost every class that needs to be taken for graduation. Physical education would not be a class since everything would be on devices which is a conflict, which is needed to graduate. Do you think students should work on assignments from school at home?

In this prompt

I will argue about how students can study from long distance, not all schools approve the current subject. Student's would not receive a scholar ship or diploma so that they can go to college and accomplishing the goal of having a better job.

Some people say that school is very important for students, that they'll earn more money than their parents who probably dont have a well paid job and education. Students have different emotions that trigger them to want to leave school behind, since they start working more to pay bills that need to be paid each month.

All students should go to school to focus on what they want to be in life or do. In many short word students will be gaining so much weight that they'll not be able to do certain sports they want or walk to their destination.

Typing online or video conferencing is not easy if the person on camera is shy and doesn't like video conferencing which can be very often. If they have a job they will consider work their first priority instead of school. Accessing to both subjects can not be trusted if the school will be monitoring every movement you take on your device. Attending classes from home can cause for students to be able to work more and do their assignments on time.

Schools will not exist if students leave to study home which will make it hard for them to communicate with teachers when help is needed. The students should be able to afford a device which is necessary to study any subject. Physical experience is not the same as typing online or video conference",0
"I think that setting a curfew time for teenagers during the week and weekends is good because it's letting them know the time they can leave there house, and the time they so there parents wouldn't worry about them leaving in the middle of night just to go out with friends. If they get home after 10pm then they are disobeying, and breaking the law which would get them in so much trouble so like the consequences would be go to court, talk with the judge, and know what there punishment would be either going to be on prohibition for 2 weeks, having an ankle bracelet so if they try to sneak out it would alert an officer then they would immediatly would be put in juvenile detention center for a week, and if those consequences don't work then they would be offically be put with an officer to take him to school, home, and work so they don't try to sneak out again. If there weekday curfew is until 10pm then it's acceptable because it's a school night so they at least just go home after school, change, and go out with friends until 10pm. this curfew time is only set only fridays and saturdays. The weekend curfew would be all day until 12am. Inconclusion I believe that havig a weekday and weekend curfew is good because it warns kids what there consequnces will be if they disobey the law and going out after curfew hours.. If they come back home after 12am then there are gonna be actual real more serious consequences like being on house arrest, be on prohibition with an officer watching you, taking you to where you're supposed to be if any of those dont work then they will just be locked up in a Juvenile detention center for 4 weeks so they would actually have no freedom only time is when they get visitation time with there parents visit, and when they are released from that place",0
"Soon that will led to communications between you and a host of other like-minded people. Let them and pay attention to them as they will become your guide to your ultimate destiny. Step into that real you and have some fun along the way. No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.

So, I totally agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson that ""To be yourself in a world is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.. You will begin to feel comfortable in your own skin. Consider he words of Dr. For example, if you want to become a musician then slowly tell people that you ""are planning a career in music"" and start acting that way. Be Yourself. You find yourself constantly trying to live up to the expectations of others and why not? It is usually a good things to follow the wishes of those who have raised you, and it is natural to conform to the ways of people who help you along the way. While showing respect for your parents and elders, start to forge your own identity. As an example, parents pay for your education, including arts and sports activities so surely it makes sense that you would try to excel in those endeavours as a form of Thank you. Everyone else is taken. This predicament can eventually morph into a personality disorder if the gap between your inner person and public persona is too wide. So just do it as the Nike ads encourage. I couldn't have said it any better.

Essentially, and ultimately, you don't have any choice in the decision about being yourself. Maybe our ""selves"" are like a blank slate waiting for someone to write the future. But, it is the only way you will reduce anxiety and eventually find a sense of fulfillment. The problem for some people however is that they harbour the inner self and keep it separate from the self they display to the world. First the pressure comes from your parents, then your young peers, on to teachers and bosses. Eventually they will tell others who are interested in the same path. Too much soul searching can lead to a sort of paralysis an inertia brought on by excessive searching for the meaning.

I think we all instinctively know what we want to do it is just some of us are a little hesitant to breakout. Those who truly love you will be on the sidelines cheering your every step. It is a most important thing to be yourself. Your network will expand and you will soon be part of a musically inclined community nurtured and growing professionally all the while gaining confidence in the new you.

Another way to look at ''finding'' yourself involves a more prosctive, less reflective path. Soon being in public will become a chore you will feel like a phony. But we all know of the pressures to please others as we grow up. Start becoming that person in your mind and begin to feel this is yourtrue self soon actions will follow. Seuss, ""Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't care''. you will probably end up living the life of the recluse. So, we need to keep this things into our selves that way we could improve our selves as the best human being in the world. Not a good result for most people except the odd monk.

The best way to allow your inner self, that part of you that holds your real aspirations and dreams, to become what the world sees is to start cultivating the key aspects of those chracter traits. Maybe we should not dwell too much on ourselves. it is alot like osmosis. Life is not about finding yourself ; Life is about creating yourself"".

This is the other side of the coin. Surprisingly, this will start you help you as other people will begin to look at you in that light. Since the time of Socrates, and no doubt before, a predominant human instinct has been to know thyself. It is also expected that prescribed pathways are followed, in a way, to repay kindness and debts. At first pass, it would seem to be obvious that you would aspire to be yourself. The same goes for showing a good teacher or mentor that you understand their lesson and often end up developing further on the path they revealed and recommended.

However, at some point your own predictions and dreams emerge",0
"sometime you do this thing, and you want to other thing on the same time.

I am a student sometime I have had homework to do. Think about how I can to my purpose. Life is your what is want to do, do more? or idle for time?       . Is it struggle in the my mind. When you be to purpose, I will wonderful done much to do. If I am idle, it is waste my time, and I can not to my purpose. Which I want to do first? If I finish my project, after the time, I can to want I want to do ,is purpose for a day.

My position is if I always focus one thing, I will cacccompish more. In the this world everyone have twenty-four hours for one day. Determine never to idle? For example; After school, I need thoughtout I have project to do, I want to relax do nothing, and I want to eat dinner. What are you doing for a day? Do you accomplish something? Everyday you want do somthing, maybe you are inactive. You do anything have had process. Never have idle for life? I think maybe, but I feel is impossible, because you can be idle, this is your life, you can decide idle or completely do something.

I believe doing something you like, you are quick accomplish. If I have some problem thing, on the idle time, I can think about find some solution",0
"You can throw a football from the 1 yard all the way to 90 yards at age 11. You are the most fastest person in the world. Everyone has a skill and a talent you just have to find it in you and trust your self that you can do it and dont give uo untill you have completed it.. You can do what many people cant do or you can even make a game out of it. Try to find out what's your best skill or what's your talen and if you are the worlds most fastest and smartest person at math you would have a good job later on for you. Find out your best skill and what your good at.

You can do what many people cant do in the world. Imagine everyone or you having a great skill or talent that you dont even know about. You can also combine talents and skills you never thought you can do if you dont try it or see it if it can work with you or with other people.

Everyone has a great talent and skill. Be the most fastest and the most smartest person in the world at math. You can never know what your good at if you dont try it out and if you can throw a football 90 yards from yard 1 at age 11 im sure later all the football team's would want you to play for there team.

Try finding out what are you good at.

"This is important because instead of people completing tasks with technology, they can easily do it themselves. People may think that the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has positive effects on their lives, but that is false. Therefore, individuals get too dependent on technology; For instance, Individuals use technology to communicate with others and they use it for location. In addition to that, people use technology to educate themselves. For example, people's vision might get blurry and people that are looking down at their electronic devices impacts their neck position. In conclusion, the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on people's lives because it can possibly impact their health in a horrible way and people get too dependent on technology, but they use it to help themselves.. Furthermore, people may slouch down when they are using a computer. Although those are beneficial perks, it causes people to be too dependent on technology. To illustrate, if people want a snack they can walk down to the store and buy it instead of ordering it online

People think that the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has positive effects on their lives since people with no available transportation can order online or if others live in a area that is dangerous, they can order online to receive the things that they want to be safe; However, technology has a negative impact since it makes people risk their health. The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on people's lives because it impacts their health in a negative way and people get too dependent on technology.

Health is very important, but people take good health for granted; To begin with, technology may impact individuals health in a negative way. This is important because people need to be more aware of what can effect their health in a horrible way.

The use of technology is phenomenal, people use it in their every day lives. Technology is taking over the world! There is now less human contact",0
"Having to wake up early and get ready on time is hard work,making it on time to school is a big task. Sometimes students are more focused on who finishes first and sometimes think it's a race. Online school could also be better for students sleep schedule, like that students could be more rested and would be able to focus on their work.

Better sleeping schedule would help kids focus more on their work and would be able to stay up, whens students dont sleep well the tend for fall asleep in class. Falling asleep in class effects on class grades because student pay less attention. Students would benefit attending school from home in many ways.... Just having online classes from home would be better for everyone in general, would honestly make students life much more easier. students would be able to work in a quiet environment with no distractions from other students. students would also have the chance of working on their own time when they can,like that students could proprobly finish their work faster. Online school should just be a thing for students because its less stressful and much easier.. Another reason why it would be better would be because, some students work in their own speed and won't be worried about how fast others finish",0

"""I want to be a computer engineer for my career"".

Students that starts to look for their specific career can plan earily for their futrue career, student that are working on their careers can work on looking for the specific college that the student that he or she is looking for their career that they plan for. If a student start seaching for his or her career can focas more on their career to find the specific college and the job that they study for their career. ""My chances on getting to the college I worked for is a high chance to get except, and I would not have no problem facing college and, my career planning to be a Computer Engineer"".. The idea of planning for a career is to perpar yourself and other for the future, career planning is to perpar yourself and other for a colleges that is specific to the career of what your looking for specific, and help plans for the career job that you or others had work for in the past.

Students that enters high school should start looking for the their career, becaue it keeps the student commit to the career, and keeps the students focas toward their future careers. ""The plans I did for my career planning was to take the class that are specific to the career i'm planning for"".

Students that study for their specific careers for the future, have a higher chance to go to their specific career college, their career job, student that worked for their career have been studying the specific career topic that they been working for, when they graduate high school they have a higher chance to get except to their career college, and their career job",0
"They go to school to create a future for themselves to be able to have a better life not all kids think like that until something wrong happens. You be able to like the career you chose because if not you will not enjoy being in the career. A career is something you have to think before you get in to an specific career because later on you might want to change the career your in right now. Should enjoy the career you pick because it gives you passion and strength to keep getting up from bed and get ready to go to school to study that career.

Finally some students at a young age that are just about to enter high school do not pay enough attention to school or the career they are studying. In high school a lot of kids change and not for good they make bad decision and totally forget why they go to school for. That means that they do not want a better life or to better themselves they do not want the help. Kids that are young do not really think in careers they mostly think on being with there friends and going out to have fun. If they do not pay attention or take it serious they will not succeed in the career as well in life because they will not be able to get a good job. At a young age kids do not really have a clue on what they really like or have an interest career wise. Kids that are still young do not really think about careers or what they can do with the career they study. In most situations kids change there minds and decide that the career they got in to does not favor them and they want to change the career. In addition they are young they do not know what is to have such a big responsibility. Also students should not have to be forced to be in a career they do not like thats why they should have time to think on what they like and what they do not like.

Next students are still young to know what career to get in to they should be forced to figure it out so quickly they should get more time to really think on it. It is a case of kids that take things seriously not all kids take everything serious and talking about school and careers that is a problem. Students should be able to really think about what they like and what interest them about a career before having just get in to it. If we did not have schools that give you the opportunity to study a career I wonder where would we be would we have good jobs that pays good enough money.

In conclusion, I do not think is a good Idea for students should commit to a career in at a young age. A career is something to take serious because in the future that would be where you will be working and if you do not like that will not be a pleasant job to work at. Students that are just to enter high school do not really know how hard they are going to have to work to be good in the career they would have selected.

First students do not really know what they have a passion for, they should not have to commit to a career they do not know if they are going to like after awhile in the career.              . I believe that students should not have to commit to a career at a young age because they will not take the career serious they will take it as a joke. Some students in high school do not really think about it, but the reason why they go to school to better there lives in the future. We do not really know what we really like until like the end of the year of high school I believe because at that time we are more matured",0
"Some say failure may negatively affects people in their life. They need to work hard to accomplish their dreams. So, he came in second place. I told him, ""why are you smiling?"" He said,"" I'm happy that you guys came, to see me race."" he was so proud. He's family was there and I was there, too. Failure plays in the pursuit of success. Although some say that success shouldn't be consist of failure because a failure makes you a loser, not a winner, actually failure plays in the pursuit of success because people fail, but they learn from their mistakes and it's positively affects people personalty.

Those who believes success shouldn't be consist of failure have their reason. I was happy for him. But, success makes people feel proud and enthusiasm. Then, I retook the test, and I got 91 out of 100, I was proud; after, I saw my score.

I know many people hate failing, they think it's negatively affects their life. My score was 50 out of 100. For example, I have cousin who into sports, and he is in race track. Such as, hard working, proud, and encourage. For example, I took math test last week, and I didn't do well on the test. Some people fail or success, but they are working hard to accomplish their dreams.

Lastly, pride and encouragement. People fail, but they can learn from their mistakes and it's positively affects people personalty. But, failing is sometimes there's benefits because it's positively affects people personality. So, I checked my test paper, and I saw what mistakes I got and learned from it. Because a failure makes you a loser, not a winner.

Failure helps people to find their a path to success. So, my cousin was in it. I was mad at first, and I saw my cousin smiling. Such as, hard working, proud, and encourage. He didn't care if he is second or last. we saw the race, we were encouraging and cheering for him. there was a race in high school between Generic_School. First, people have their dreams, some wants to be a football player, or some wants to be a president. People fail, but they can learn from their mistakes. He cares about his relative cheering for him.

Conclusion, Failure plays in the pursuit of success. I believe failure helps people to find their a path to success",0
"If you learn to take risks, you later get use to it and you can speak more in front of people and state your opinion. One of the greatest artists, Michelangelo, said that setting our aim too low and achieving it is a great danger for some of us. In today's society, many people agree that having a simple goal and achieving it is better than having a huge goal and failing to achieve it, but i disagree. Even if you take the high route and fail, it does not mean you can try again. Taking risks can make you a better person as a whole and those mistakes can help you improve.

Michelangelo and I agree that having a bigger goal and failing is better than having a small goal and achieving it. Setting a higher aim for yourself is better because you can improve your skills and knowledge. People view their mistakes and overcome it so they can do better next time. People can learn from past mistakes by seeing what went wrong and practice doing better at it; for example, in a show called

Masterchef, chefs must impress the judges by their skills in cooking but one chef gets eliminated every episode. Another example is having a meeting for a job. Smaller aims are a scapegoat compared to bigger aims because of how much easier they are. I agree with Michelangelo because you learn from past mistakes, you learn to take risks, and having bigger goals help you improve ones self.

Michelangelo is a great artist because of his work, but he learned from his own work to keep moving forward. Small goals do not involve much effort and work as bigger achievements; by choosing to accomplish a simple task, you as a person may get use to the easy way out and can get lazy over time. These examples prove that you have the ability to learn from past mistakes, grow as a person, and that you might have to take risks in doing so.

Taking risks are mostly involved in big decisions that involve jobs, education,etc. It is best to challenge yourself so that you are ready for anything that comes your way. Another example is taking the permit test as a teenager. In a show called Shark Tank, people come in to persuade investors to invest in their products, but they do not always succeed. Michelangelo rather fail by doing something big than his life than doing something small and achieving it. Having a bigger goal can increase your confidence and help you put your head in the task you want to overcome. In conclusion, setting a bigger aim and failing is alright and better than setting a small aim due to it being more easy.. When a chef gets eliminated their dreams may get crushed, but they had the courage to go on and did their best and can learn what they did wrong. The people who do not get investments keep moving forward and take their own risks to get a investor. He stated this thought because he failed and made mistakes before he was known as a great artist. It is best to have a meeting in person than online because it is not as easy so you get challenged and the person interviewing can know you better and you can most likely get the position. The permit test is something big for teens since it is something related to their future. When I took the test I was nervous and failed by one question, but i checked the answers I got wrong and studied them a bit more and passed the next time I took it. Setting a bigger aim and failing is best because you learn from your mistakes, you learn to take risks, and bigger goals help improve ones self. Bigger goals are better because of how much they help you improve.

A great artist once said it is great danger setting a small aim for yourself. I believe that taking risks are better than small decisions even if those risks don't turn out the way you wanted them too",0

To conclude, it is one of the most valuable factors, that everyone needs to know about it and share it with others. To help them get through their hard times and hold their hand and guide them to the right path, where they can work on themselves and build up what they have lost in the past. Positive attitude can help people to rebuild their identities and to stay focus on daily activities. They still need more attention and encouragement for their good deeds and being a rule model for kids. society will introduce them as a rule model, their good deeds and positive attitudes will encourage kids to call them, their real life heroes. People who has a positive attitude will always think creatively and find different ways to solve their problem. They will respect the dignity of others. Positive attitude is the key to a successful and happy life. For example: sometimes people will lose themselves in world with so many people, at the same they can find themselves with the right person who can guide them to the right path in a lost world. However its not good for their life. It cause them a lot of family problems, problems in public, and in school. People with positive attitude are people who will not let you down, they will not break their promises, and they will not lose your trust. for example most of the people who has a positive attitude are more knowledgeable, They will help others in their problems, they will seek ideas, information, and share their personal experiences just to help others in their hard times and show them the right way. People needs to spend more time with people who has positive attitudes. However these experiences are so helpful for the people who want to change their bad attitude to positive attitude. 3/5 people in the world has a positive attitude. Positive attitude is the key to successful,self respect, and self-confident. A lot of people are smart, they have money, but they are lacking on having a positive attitude. People who has positive attitude are intelligent and smart, they have a solution for every problem, they will act the same, they will have the same energy, they will not give up easily. people who has positive attitude are the most honest, trustworthy and they are so down to earth people. In order to gain self-respect and confidence people needs to have a positive attitude. They will take responsibility for your actions and their consequences.

People with positive attitude are symbols to kids and for the upcoming generation. Therefore we need more people who has positive attitude and at the same amount of time they can help others to change for the better version of themselves. People who has a positive attitude will impact the society in good terms. People with positive attitudes are so caring, balanced, and have a lot of experiences from life. People who has positive attitude will act more with integrity and honesty. It has been proved that people who has a positive attitude has the highest acceptance rate in a community, then the people who do not have a positive attitude. which it includes as a good experiences and bad experiences",0
"when people ask for advice, sometimes seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by seeing if most peoples opinions are the same and its a good advice some opinions maybe better then others , you can also recave better advice from differnt people like your best friend can give you an advice that will help you lot but the other person that you dont really talk to that person doesnt really know how to help you like your best friend does , each opinion can help you with something different like some one may give you advice about a sport you may not need it right now but you could use it later in life so each opinion can help you later in life it may not help you never know , for example if you need advice on how to do better in school or how to get your grades up you would ask a teacher or your friends but someone else can give you bad advice or it doesnt helpe youor on how not to do well in school so its better to ask multiple peolpe then just one because you have a higher chance of getting good advice frome differnt people and you have more to opinions then just asking one persone beacse he may not have th best advice but he will try to help but you have a lower chand you can see wich helpe more and wich dont really dont helpe you would be getting good advice that will sadisfide you, so in my opinion asking multiple people for advice is better is a better chose then just asking one persone.",0
"now doing bad things is not right because you can be success for a while. for example it can be stealing or drugs if you are dong those things you will be success but is not a right choice for you and you keep doing it one day you will have to pay for what you did, most people prefer to work hard every day to be able to have at least everything, I prefer people to do the right thing because doing bad is not going to get you anywhere you might be success but it wont be forever id rather work hard so i can be success in life . I disagree with the statement about a positive attitude is the key to success in life because there's others things you need to be success in life anyone can have a positive attitude and they are not success or probably won't be, theres only few percent of people in this world that are success there are some people that dont have a positive attitude and they are success in life.

For example people with a positive attitude they try so hard to be success in life but they cant they keep trying, trying and nothing happens. now some people with a bad attitude are success they dont even have to try to work hard to be success.

Image how many people work hard and hard every day just be success in life, but theres a couple of people that have a positive attitude and they are success in life basically living life great, there are people people that dont have a positive attitude they just do bad things to be success",0
"First impressions are the reasons why people don't get along because they think different about each other.

In my experience on first impressions are always bad, because when I'm going to talk to someone and the first thing I do before talking to them is judge them in good way. Many people think that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Even the animals have first impressions, because when you are trying to buy a dog, the dog is going to have a first impression because the dog is getting an owner. And when someone tries to change their first impressions they always fail. That is an example of first impressions.

I think that if you're trying to change your first impressions is going to be difficult, because you can't change something that is going to happen before you meet someone new. First impressions is something that every human has in their lives and they can't change it, because is a part of their lives. For example, if I'm going to a new school and I go my first day of classes, and I don't know no one in that school, and I want to talk to someone or be friends with someone, I'm going to have to talk to people in the new school, and before I talk to them I always think if they are good people or bad people. So that's why First impressions are almost impossible to change.. I agree with this statement, because first impressions is something that is hard to change in your life. And if think that someone is bad, but in reality she/he is a really nice person",0
"As people; We all want to be praised for how we work and we can only get better if we practice something over and over and over again and can get even more if we`re happy with what we`re practicing and happiness comes with every praise. They would improve but students also develop zero tolerance to any criticism and probably going to want all the attention focused at them.

A great example to this would be any artist; artists are based all around the idea of everything they make are things that they'll hate even if theres true improvement. Should a students work be praised no matter how bad it is? This sounds like a good idea in theory, but when you think of it only in the educational field is really a terrible thing to do. they get praised but thats not what drives them to do better its the hatred of what they do that gives the motivation to improve and even take criticism with a grain of salt but use it to get better. But if all we got while learning was praise but nothing to improve on then what would be the point to continue learning if all we get is a ""this is amazing"" or an A+ on every assignment they got. I`m not saying that praising to much is a bad thing and i`m also not saying you should make the student hate what they`re doing. Using what we learned from any artist it`d be a terrible thing to do, as the purpose of a student is to learn and use what they learned in the world and in the world theres going to be people who criticize what they do and if they cant take that criticism they`re most likely gonna get fired.

In conclusion. But i am saying that with every praise should be a criticism just to balance it out and show the students that with every positive comes a negative and that the worlds not just going to be all praise to a person.",0
"Clearly, getting involved into different jobs will even give you different alternatives.

Pursuing this further, knowledge is very important when it comes to trying something new. Wouldn't you want to invest in the creature more? Learn how the creature lives? Or you would just want to know the basic facts of it? . Just by having lack of experience will lead the individual feeling in their comfort zone. For instance, my friend Generic_Name shes a server at a restaurant. She told me high school it will get harder . Surprisingly this creature changes colors, sizes, and shape. All around the world involves people learning something new. Also, the lack of knowledge will leave the person clueless. Some people believe that Emerson statement ""unless someone try to do something beyond what they've have already mastered will grow"", but I disagree. For some reason, she doesnt want to try something new.

Having only one job experience is barely enough for the person to know about different experiences from other jobs. How can someone grow from repeating on doing what they do on a normal basis? How can they learn something new with such little knowledge? For example, my dad came to United States when he was 14 years old. Also, he knew how to write some words, but that was all that he knew. Mostly likely I will have to pass all exams, sols ,and keep my GPA high. Individuals need to know atleast some knowledge when trying to reach further into their career

For example, my eighth grade teacher Generic_Name would sometimes sit with me at lunch. He put his full time effort to learn a new language. Unfortunately, she getting tired of the job. He knew little English. There's literally a certain career that every individual is discovering for. I believe people who try to do something beyond what they've have already mastered, they will never grow because due to lack of experience, and not enough knowledge.

To begin with, every individual want to become something in life. Since my middle schools years were coming to an end. I asked her if their were any advice for my upcoming freshman year. He himself grew out of the stage of not knowing something. I strongly believe,as if Generic_Name does not put effort into applying for a new job. I strongly oppose, knowing more knowledge about something will make yourself grow.

Obviously, if an individual is trying to do something beyond then what they've already mastered, they will never grow. Each step he took he accomplished. Generic_Name has been working there since she was 17 years old already. Also, I needed to become more serious about my education. These are the years I will0 start thinking about what I want to do with my career. Therefore, Generic_Name knows all of the meals that are served, places that need to be restocked etc. One day, I brought up about going into high school. We learn about different creatures, peoples ,and objects. People who wants to learn, participate in certain activities or classes would most likely get the dream career as they wish. Imagine doing a science project on an unknown animal. We would discuss about anything. She is nineteen years old. Putting the effort is the answer to everyone problems. She gave me advice to guide me through to become better. An Individual that is willing to learn more each and everyday will succeed in life. He went beyond into what he really wanted.

Finally, everyone needs experience and knowledge in order to grow. She will never grow out of her self esteem or confidence into getting a new job. Some people may argue that unless the person try to do something beyond what they have mastered, they will grow",0
"Scientist Albert Eisnste sad "" imagination is more important than knowledge "" I disagree with the statement.

I disagree imagination is more important that knowledge.

I disagree because, I think knowledge it's more important because, you have to knowledge after you imagine because, I think knowledge it'a more important because you have to knowledge. and if you knowledge first after think you can be able to due son tings.

If you gonna to due a story if you only imagine you can not be able to due because you have to Knowles the situation first after you think because son times you can get good imagination and you have to knowledge.

like for example if don't knowledge you don't gonna now were put tings to knowledge the situation were you gonna put things and the ca n be better.

I don't no what scientists Albert Einstein think and i gonna now what he thinks because, people have different opinion like how it's more better to they can use, and because persons have different ideas,like me i think then knowledge it's more important, then imagination but others people they can think it'snot because for people to see things it's different, because if the person am gonna write the story am gonna use the knowledge to knowledge, the situation better and make good story.

The knowledge it's like then a group because you have to search or knowledge to now what you gonna due because, if you only have in a imagination to what you gonna due that can work, like when you go to your job and you have to knowledge,what you gonna due for the day.

when you go to school and you go to science if you have to examine the a plant you have to knowledge the plant to now were you can star to examine the plant.

when you due sometimes you have to knowledge the situation,like for example,when a person quilled to another person, the police they have to knowledge,the scene and who was the criminal and knowledge the situation how died and who was .

some people think the imagination it's was first and it's more important would, I think the people see for different forms to due would a think some people it's right because, I see for different forms like when you imajinate it's like when you imajinate the things would you can have a picture in your minds like you can see pictures like were you what to put things.

but you can have im imajine in your mied but you have to knowledge first because i think if you knowleged because i feel more necesary to knowleged beause when you knowledged you can feel it's more easy or if you look like the pictures way it's more easy, because you see the things more specific en your miend.

it's alot ways to you can see things because for people some people looks diferets to others you can see more better in you way if you don't get.

i think people it's look things different ways and other they look like the same but the most important it's the way you see the tings for you.. The situation to think really good if you dont due you can not think what it's gonna happen.

because if you only imagine you don't gonna knowledge good because, if you only imajinate and say the words after you knowledge the words you what to says",0
"some people dismal when they got failure in thier life.

They are become depression most of them and finally when they got success in thier life they are become happy, and depreciation. for many resons: fristly,must of students, agree with this statement that Minister Winston Churchill once said. because we all human making mistake in our life. we want to success,in improve our self.

Many people making a mistake in thier life some of them success, and most of them failure. because before that i said faliure of key is becoming in success in our life we should all battle with failure we all know that way is become austerity. and aslo he siad that, this a good convenience for everone in consequence Lincoln, said you guys have to conscious and be awake all the time. however we all taking lesson from faliure to faliure to be come success in our life. we want to success once time. the constant to be succsess consists of going from failure. however they are thanking we do not want to failure in our life or tests. must of them said this is not compulsion or compulsory, they said this is over las conclusive in our decide we want to success one time without lossing any enthusiasm or failure.

In my opinion that "" succcess consists of going from failure to failure without loos of enthusiasm. Many people believe that success consists of going from failure. previosly must of people agree failure is key is success.

for example: Abraham Lincoln, one of the 16th president of the U.S, once time said in during in civil war said to his people or audience, we have to be strong, does not matter for us how hard is life is it . of course that"" success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.. we have to fight with failure we did not want to win us. we agree in this prompt. whatever success, going from failure to faliure without loos any of enthusiasm. and secondary, part of students did not believe in this statement. being faliure is good for must of peoples. this confirm to everyone or to all of us key of failure is in success.

other peoples , did not agree what Abraham Lincoln said. and he continue his speech he said. he said never contrition in your past. this is our life.

no mather success congsists of going from failure to faliure",0
"because during the vacation, we go to the beach, work, play with friends and family, visit friends or family that live far away or in other state, and sleep more. Because during the period of the school we do not have time to go out. We need more weeks to rest and enjoy the beach and many things. This is a good idea, and the educators should be agree with this. This is what I think that how the school should be, but every head is a different world, and that make think the people in different ways to do things.. This is how the school should be because it is hard to be here everyday, and it is so boring sometimes. During winter take precautions because can be really dangerous, and we would have more time to do many things at home or might be work, and have more time with the family. I think idea is great. This should be note by the educators and think the days or weeks break that they want to give to the students.

In conclusion the educators should be agree with this idea, and think that we more weeks to rest and enjoy the summer. I think this is the reason why people think the Winter Break should be more longer because they know what can happen. We fell the summer is not enough time for us to enjoy the vacations. We only do homework, projects and many others things, and that is the reason that I like this idea because is the best way to enjoy the summer and have more time to rest. Winter should be more longer because during this season is very cold and dangerous, I think winter break should be more longer.

Because Winter is a beautiful season of the year, but it is also a problem because during this period of the year, if people who drive do not take precaution they would have serious problems, and I think the school should be closed during this period, because the buses can slide on the ice, and can cause a big accident, and this is a risk, because many people can die. Because this is seriously, we have to be more careful during winter, many students come to school, buses drive over the snow, and this is a risk, I think this is a great idea why winter should be more longer, and more weeks of vacation, this days of snow should be make up on the spring. Summer Break should be more longer. The educators should know this and think about. They know the dangerous the snow it is, we all know that is beautiful, but can be very painful. I am agree with this people who think that the summer should be four weeks of break, and a long winter break",0
"Actually, people is not agree because people think that is not importat statement for them and thats why people are not agree with the statement.

In conlusion, people should be agree with Churchill statement because he don't want to people to loose their enthusiasm, that's hy people are agree with the Chuchill important statement because they feel success.. I'm so shy when I have to do presentations, I don't feel confortable. People sometimes said that they going somewhere but they said that they don't want to go alone because he/she feels weird, like if you are new in this country, they tell maybe to their cousins to go with him/her.

People should be agree with Churchill statement about the important role that failure play in the pursuit of success because that makes you feel successed and that makes you to be a good person. Churchill consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm, he said that because he wants to animate people to not be shy of anything and I'm agre with that.

Some say Churchill go from failure to failure without loss enthusiasm because sometimes people feel shy when they are doing somehing that they don't want to do, like me. But we have to get out our fears, that are killing us to not do what we have to do. Actually, Churchill said that because he want to people to not loose their enthusiasm in something that they want and that is a good choose.

People should not be agree with Churchill statement about the important role that failure play in the pursuit of success because I think people don't want to do want Churchill said in the statement and they are not going to follow the statement ",0
"He says if you never grow and you have already mastered. The humanity do things inimaginables and thas is cool but the thing is they can try to do is impossible understannding, and if you can try and fail thats is your problem then personas can do whatever they want and thats it. So you can try something.

1. Agree they can try to do somethin better

You try to do something beyond yours hands and that is a little bit imposible if you can do you can do and thats all. think febore to do. ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered""

"Students find what they really like to do in life while being in high school but some students need a lot of time to find out what is that thing that they love and want to do for the rest of their lives. Graduating Early is a Bad Idea

Personally I think graduating in three years instead of the traditional four years should not be allowed. While being in high school, students learn how to adapt to new environments, new people and even different languages so that way when they go to college they are ready for anything. School should really think about this idea before making it an actual thing, because for some students this could be a good thing, but for some students this could be really bad.

Graduating early to me is a bad idea because, I dont think it gives students the right amount of time to learn everything they need to learn while being in high school. Students that do want to follow this plan and graduate a year early, are going to have to go to school during the summers or in the evinings, if students do that then they won't be able to get a job and work what being in hish school and they won't be able to learn to manage their money and to figure out what's good or bad for them economically.

I have a friend her name is Generic_Name, she graduated a year early because she took online classes and stayed after school to graduate a year early. Generic_Name goes to college and has trouble adapting to the new environment and dealing with defferent types of people, Generic_Name is having emotional pronlems because she is not sure anymore about what she wants to do in life. Students that play sports need to play for a good amount of time to get better at it and maybe get an scholarship, students that take mechanic courses or photography courses need a good amount of time to learn about everything they need to dominate on whatever they do, so that way colleges can come to their school, watch them and find out if they deserve a scholarship or not. In high school students go through situations, make mistakes and bad decisions, learn how to fix those things and not do them again.             . Give students the right amount of time to learn everything they need to be ready for the real world. Generic_Name and I talk everyday and she tells me about everything she goes through, she tells me she can't get a boyfriend because she doesn't know how to maintain a healthy relationship, she tells me she's having economical problems because she's doesn't know how to manage her money because while being in high school she worried more about getting her credits than actually learning what she had to learn to be ready to the real world.

In conclusion I think is a bad idea for schools to allow students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years of high school",0

"Everyone loss in there life and they learn from that.

Reasons why people fail. Because they think that we are not good at this. Like this you don't need to lose enthusiasm in your life. If they don't understand or learn from there mistakes. I do my work again and again. I don't Speak and understand English. They try it again and now we are read about them. peoples who are around them they need to help them motivate them so they can try it again. Some people when they fail they learn what they did wrong and next time they fix it. What i did wrong. Like if you are not in a basketball try soccer or baseball. I do my work very hard. Now i am good in math.

When i came in United State. When someone motivate other they get energy to do something. I read my question and find mistakes. Like Airplane, Electricity, Computers, Cars, and many others things.

Some people fail in there life. If anyone did any mistake try to fix it. I speak English at home with my brother and sister they fix my mistakes and its help me to speak better English.

Some people when they loss they don't try it again. They can't get success in there life. Because they did many things. Then i fix my mistakes. Any word i don't understand i look in dictionary. Get help from your family or your friends.

When i was in 9th Grade. If you can't fix it. people need to understand other problems and help them. I don't like math. Because no one understand them so they think that no one care about them. Then he/she is so afraid to walk. Then someone help his/her put his/her hand on the shoulder. Choose that and do hard work on that. They try again but still they fail. But do that you are good in and easy for you. If you like another thing thats hard for you. She help me lat to learn math. practice every day don't be lazy.

I want to say that do what ever do you want to do. Tell them that you make this mistake try to fix this and you will be better.

When someone break his/her leg. do hard work on it and make easy for you. because he/she think that it's very painful. like Sport coaches motivate there team before they match. Because i did my work hard now i get the success. how this world work? help others then they will help you not all ways.. Cause of that they can't get success. I made many mistakes to write the work or speak. Don't be afraid to loss next time try with more power. Then they slowly slowly put weight his/her leg. I ask my teacher about anything that i don't understand. When you feel failure see other people read about them that how they fight when they fail.

Many American famous people loss in there missions but they don't loss there hope. So try something else that easy for you and you can make your life better. Because i don't understand math question. If i can't find word in dictionary i ask my teachers. which one is easy for you. Thats help us make easy and fast to do our work or travel. Don't lose enthusiasm. Yes,I agree failure plays in the pursuit of success. I try my best and I learn English from my teachers from my friends",0
"Also you and your dog can have some time together.

Another enjoyable way to do at the park is, you can have a picnic with your family of friends. Having picnics at the park can be good for example, the weather when it is hot or warm or it is a beautiful day outside. While you are walking your do, you are also getting some exercise by walking with them. You can also go look at the pig races. It's also fun because the dog can explore new places to go to.

Also it's somewhere you can take your dog to go out and enjoy nature with you. Sometimes when you go see the animals at the park some people can tell you some stuff to learn about the animal like where is is from or what it eats and you can feed the animal food that the park provides them to eat.

Last but least, you can ride your bike, stake board, and scooter. When you are done with your picnic you can go and explore more of the park. Having a picnic is fun because you get to talk to the person with you and eat with them. It is enjoyable to look at the animals for example, the bears, fishes, turtles, goats, chickens, and pigs. Some dogs like walking, so a park is a good place to take them to go walk. If you brought someone with you and they never been there before then they might like it and they would want to come back again.

Third enjoyable way to do at the park is, some parks have animals you can look at. At the park you can learn how to ride the the thing you brought and practice. While you are riding on what you brought with you, it is fun to ride it while you see the beautiful features of the park. There could be some animals you may have never seen before. The park is also a safer place because there won't be a lot of cars.

"so he change to materials and process to learn how to cut, and built houses.

One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because, when you are in a young are you make the wrong decision well sometimes but I think the best decision for me during high school is to to wait and study the better classes and the best and better career. all those classes that I selected from freshman year are not gonna be worth it because you gonna have to take new classes. they courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career. One topic that people debate a lot is that students expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. I will explore all type of career when my senior junior year starts I would make sure to select the right courses and the better one to be prepared or have experience for your career.

One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because sometimes teenagers are careless something may go wrong with your life or you just wanna do something new. I think is not a good idea for a student to commit to a career at a young age. and to be able to do that you have to care about classes and be responsible with school and career.

As you read you can see the reasons,I think the best idea for students is to focus in high school and get good grades when you get to senior year or college, you know more about life and careers I think that would be the best time to selected the best classes that are gonna guide you toward a specific career.. they not prepared for the world students in high school don't have any experience of any career.

I think is a little to early. for example my friend selected a technology class in freshman year, and he search it up how much they make in a year and that was not what he expected. because students are not old enough they careless and not make the best decision when they at a young age.

"The first reason why we should have cell phones is because some parents like to check up on there son's and that can't happen in policy two, but in policy one we can do that and if you are a parent wouldn't you like to check up on your son or daughter? Second, I don't see why we shouldn't be able to bring them at all because say we forgot our homework at home and say we already missed a day of homework and if we miss another one we will get a detention, we can just call our mom during lunch break or passing period and tell her if she can bring our home work. Lastly, say we are in a lock down because someone had a gun in the campus and the man or women cuts the power off so no one can call through the telephones we can just grab our cell phones and call the police. Dear principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I want you to consider policy one for various reasons. I'm not asking you to approve it I'm asking to considerate please.",0
"Furthermore parents have to a limitation on their kids and put a limit on them.. I think teenager need a limitation of what they doing in the phones. Since wedsides liike Amazon, Ebay, and others came up people atart get all they need from wedside. We can do alot of things with out it. Some people say the kids have to have limitation of what they doing on they computer or cells phones. For example: Play outside with friends, go to libraries, and stay outside with natural. On the other hand some people say that that tenenager can't complete a taskd with out having contact with other person. Buying staff for the internet is getting wrong because people do not want to go aout and spend time with family. Bad people are used this on favor to them, they are creating so many fake wedsides to racket people.

To continue with, I think a good way to get the kid out the technology is take them to have fun outside like hand out with friends, having friends in a computer like into a videogame or a social media is not healty for the kids. At this time everybody are forgeting how beutiful is lives with out technology. Wedsides are not save you have to have a limitation and also take care of the like. On the other side people say that is good for teenager having not limitation because they can learn more. If you going to buy anything for the internet just make sure the wedside is safes. When you meet a strager in the internet is dangeous, not everyone is a good person. People that are seeling on wedsides that always offer what the really have or maybe they just want the money. Furthermore parents should cheking what they doing in the internet.

However, some people think is good for teenager not having a limitation because they learn more for their future. Had the technology a negative or positive effects on people's lives? People are having a negative effects with the technology, I think people can't control it. I think this is having a negative effects on people lives, people are getting racket because they used to maney wedsides. I thinbk having a conversition with other is good because you get to know that person and also get stronger the relationship. I think having a conversiation to you or playing games without speaking I think that have a limitation until you know well that person.

In addition, sometimes people used to buy alot of things from the internet without knowing that person, that is dangerous. Kid are also getting into the technology they are losing their childhooh. You have to get to know the person before play or talk to them. Some parents think that the kids are just playing in the internets but they do not. Sometimes people trick the kids ask them to do bad things.

That why technology shoul not be allow for kid at all or if parents decide to give a cells phone or a computer always have to be a limitation.

Technology does not aloww people to complete task with out haave a contact with others",0
"The weekend curfew would be all day until 12am. If they get home after 10pm then they are disobeying, and breaking the law which would get them in so much trouble so like the consequences would be go to court, talk with the judge, and know what there punishment would be either going to be on prohibition for 2 weeks, having an ankle bracelet so if they try to sneak out it would alert an officer then they would immediatly would be put in juvenile detention center for a week, and if those consequences don't work then they would be offically be put with an officer to take him to school, home, and work so they don't try to sneak out again. this curfew time is only set only fridays and saturdays. If there weekday curfew is until 10pm then it's acceptable because it's a school night so they at least just go home after school, change, and go out with friends until 10pm. Inconclusion I believe that havig a weekday and weekend curfew is good because it warns kids what there consequnces will be if they disobey the law and going out after curfew hours.. If they come back home after 12am then there are gonna be actual real more serious consequences like being on house arrest, be on prohibition with an officer watching you, taking you to where you're supposed to be if any of those dont work then they will just be locked up in a Juvenile detention center for 4 weeks so they would actually have no freedom only time is when they get visitation time with there parents visit, and when they are released from that place. I think that setting a curfew time for teenagers during the week and weekends is good because it's letting them know the time they can leave there house, and the time they so there parents wouldn't worry about them leaving in the middle of night just to go out with friends",0
"That being hard and strict with students would make them strong to commite their task.

Student's can broke easily, help them find a good way to improve is being a good teacher,praise them for mistakes but still telling them one way to keep going.. They believe that the source of self-steem is achievement. True self-steem come from praise,praising someone for at least try to do their best built self confident. However,deficient work always need new ideas from experts and people that know about the topic,another praise given, can be tips, to get a work better next time.

Praising someone for their effort of trying to get a adecuated work done ,let them know that get better each day, its a opportunity, that they can make. Give away some ideas,tips and reasons to improve their self with a second chance. When a student is self-confident, is less insecured with every step that they make and can keep going without tryng to go back to were they have started. Sometimes people have no self confident and help then to built one,can be a really good praise, not apreciate someone else effort ,to make a really hard task for them, can give the impression of being a bad person or a person that does not want them to improve.

Others believe that praise given to deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards",0
"work alone give stress and that show someone who want to make everything by his\herself they share their own ideas. Elsewhere, work alone is base in just you, and what you know, if something that you did it, come to be wrong, you will not share it. the change of ideas always will be a good work and the can support your reasons, why you had make it.

Work in group include: less work, time, and money, back to work alone you have your own words, spend a lot of your time more than you think, also could take too much time to finish. Therefore, it's not bad get help from other people, everyone say, "" two head think better than one.""

Groups make different way to share or send a message, a few people can create a lot, base in their share of thoughts, abilities, and decisions. To different of groups students can do other activities. A group of students have skill to take decisions, there're a lot way to do, students can react to any problem, but work alone can be good as a group, people who like work alone have abilities: reasoning, recognize, and expression. Groups have the most of attention in this case. If people who like work by their self can't support ideas with reasoning, can't do a perfect project. Groups were created to share ideas. The group help to students to learn and combine new thought from other students. In my opinion is more beneficial working in groups that show us compare, analyze, and be friendly with others.. Friends can help to get a correct answer or do a good work.

The important of groups is that students learn to share, help, and be kind with other students make a friend, besides that learn, help, and teach to other, they make fun their work. Sometimes work alone can be a good choice, because is you're wrong, you can't blame to nobody.

In conclusion, I believe that groups are more helpful for students, because they learn to take other decision and compare. About work alone, I'm not agree, because you try to do something, maybe that's good, but you're not count with other ideas, expressions, or declaration of other thought",0
"Kids realize that there are a lot of other things that they could like. I had a friend, and he really loved psychology. This is why I should get the opportunity to go. Almost everyone wants to be a policeman, a fireman, a teacher, or a doctor. Find out who they are.

A few of this students are not really insterested in this opportunities. They might learn things that interested them. I know if one of them fails me I still have the other one. For some students this is a big privilege. They all should have a second plan in case plan A is not working so well. If they are lucky enough they could find the career they like. If in any case there was not what I am interested in then I will try new things.. Although some students think this opportunities are useless, actually it opens a lot of doors at a young age to learn about the things they like. They have to hope the best and get ready for the worst.

Some students think this opportunity is lame for not having what they want to learn about. It might be better than it looks.

Also, If they find the program they like and try it out they might find out if they truly like it. While others grow with the same mentality. Although it was too late to back up he realized that psychology was not what he was looking for. Sometimes is really hard to get this opportunities. Sometimes is hard to see that learning about new things could give huge benefits.

Other students realize that it could be fun to learn about new things. Midway through the year he found out that he is not so good at it. I also have two careers in mind. Some others see that there are a lot of benefits in it and go for it. He took the class this year because he thought it could be interesting. It does not only happens when they are little. When they grow up their way of thinking chances. Some of them make it happen, but some others change their mind in the way. Normally people get use to the things they like, and they don't want to learn new things. Everyone should be ready just incase there is a rush change, and they have to take a decision in less than a day. If students get the chance to learn about what they like they should take advantage of it. Sometimes people believe they have what they want and that there is nothing that could stop it. I classify myself as the kind of student that takes new chances. It could happen when they grow up, so they should give it a try to new things. They tend to think that is useless just because they don't have the program they are insterested in. I truly want to know if the careers I have in mind are what I want to do the rest of my life. When kids start to go to school teachers always ask them to think about what they want to be when they grow up",0
"I think sometime is good online because any students no have time so many students work part time,then can't go to the school the better option is take a little free time and make online.

First :But is better they go to the school because if you need something you can took with you teacher or partner is past time with amazing friends and learning more about what do you want in the future ,the things and feelings ,ideas and occurrences ,memories and expectations and possibilities ,fear desires ,delight the smallest and most ordinary issues of our lives as well as the large and mostpowerful ones. then online web is the tools for study we have that permit us to share with others what is really going on inside our minds and hearts .they are the only intruments that reveal whether speaks and writes .

second : some times the students no came at the school because they live long them no have money for transportation or when need buy any book ,any students don't have the support of your family ,i think is the way more easy and very well for the people can do it some thing ,we need more people have want learning more the way the best election for our the student speaks , writes and lives not on a thing barren changeless level but with all the breadth and height and depht and movement yyou have a right to as a human being .As you ever open discover those words ,the online can be the most important web you ever open.

Third:There are probably very few people would claim online las their favorite book .However all the words are there ,it is the order ,But if you need company whose work it is to prepare materials that advance your learning and show you how to think for yourselves , the online web is the reason the words stand for things and feelings , from outline and notes to the final form of the paper .It tells you how to write paper .how prepare for applying for a job .However It gives you advice you need to choose the correct language and to avoid expressions ,after its helps you understanding their parts and pronunciation .

Finally : The online web is very well for everybody because in the web we can find the signification about whatever word, that we dont know and helps for keep going more learning for get good job ,after you can use the online web for look video that you are curious then helps own like better people make our life better for everybody, if you dont know the support your family the class online help for you keep gonig learning more .",0
"Know she can make pupusas and cakes, but not only that, she was trying to do different stuff, so know she almost have her own restaurant. People should try to do more things because trying new things is like an adventure, people learn more things and growing makes you a better person.

Trying new things is like an adventure. They need to do things to know who they are, what makes them special, what can they do, what are capables of, what can they do, in what they are good, how they feel doing something. Then I thought ""I need to speak with other so I can practice more"" but I was so scared that people wouldn't understand me but I had to try, and then I start trying to talk with others, now I am not afraid of talk with others enymore, my english is growing and my experiences too. She enjoy the club and she learnd how to play basketball, know in this semester they have a club about volleyball, she doesn't know how to play volleyball, but she wanted to learn something more, know she is in the club of volleyball. Doing something means growing, growing in knowledge, education, skills and more. In her school after school they make clubs about sports. She knows that if she wants to success she need to try and if she fail, she need to try again until she made, that knowing one thing doens't mean that's all she can do.

Unless people try to do something beyond what they know, they will never grow. When people want to do something beyond what they know they would fail, but failing doesn't mean you can't do it, failing means you are almost gaining what you want, you are almost reaching your goal, you are doing great, because you know what to do and what not to do. . Last semester they had a club about basketball, she didn't know how to play basketball, but she wanted to learn, she wanted to try something knew. My oldest sister know how to make cakes, she thought that was all she can do, but one time I dare her to do a recipe that is famous in my country, ""pupusas"" she didn't know how to make it, but she try, she fail and what she cook was really bad, but she started to practice and try until she reach it. Are you impress of how some persons can have more than one career, do you wonder how they make that happen, how they did it, how thwy make it until the end. When people try to do something they start by trying and when they try, they fail and when they fail they learn something new, so next time that they try do not make the same mistake. People who do more than they know, makes them smarter, they try new things, things that they didn't know that they could do. Just because something did not go like you wanted doens't mean it didn't work, it mean something went bad and you don't need to do it again, so next time that you try you already know what not to do. When people do something that they did not know or want it to know more about it, they look at that like a new experience, something that they would enjoy to do. Experiences make people better, growing makes people better, trying makes people better, all person are capable of doing what they want. She learn how to play 2 sports, she is growing in knowledge of sport, if she can play volleyball and basketball that means she can play any sport she likes or wants. When I came here I thought I wouldn't learn english and that I wouldn't have friends, but then I thought ""If I don't start practicing or trying to learn I won't be able to communicate with others"" so I start trying and know I speak a little bit more and understand a little bit more. She demonstrate me that doing more than I know is awesome, that it can teach me new things and that I am capable of doing more than I know.

People learn more things. I would be stuck if I hadn't try.

My sister is in middle school, she likes to do sports, she knows how to play some but not others. Have you ever wonder what would happen if you know more about something you like, something you want to experience, how people can do many things, how they learn how to do a lot of things. People who knows a lot of things means that they have been trying differents things",0
"Imagine the president and the government of our country being nothing but idle and letting the country run on its own. the country was poor, people died because of huger, disease etc but now the country has accomplished so much then the people in our past would have imagined. If a whole country can accomplish so much from not being lazy then imagine what a person can accomplish.

I believe there are people who supports on being idle more that have to do work. There would be no regulation in the country. There is always something to do in this world; we accomplish more when we aim higher. There are people who believe in not having to go outside their house because they have all the technologies or they think they have nothing to do. We talk about the American Dream a lot but being lazy and just waiting for something to happen will not take us anywhere.

As Thomas Jefferson said, ""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"", I agree that if we always do something we accomplish more.

We as human beings have so much potentials in us but we will never discover it through inactive.

Firstly, I believe that inventions and new discoveries have made people more lazy and inactive. We had a government who let the country run free, this had a great impact to the country. The history would repeat itself and many of the tragic historical events that happened in the past would happen again. The country is well know all over the world now. The country has accomplished by establishing government regulation which removed all the laziness from the country. If we could just go out and just help one person and day, that person would help another and another to another, this would be such a great accomplishment.

In conclusion, I agree on what Thomas Jefferson said and believe that there is more happiness in doing something everyday then being a idle. I dont blame Inventions and discoveries because they were made with good intentions and not through idle ism but there are people who trust inventions more then they have to. laziness is a big wooden door which can only open by ourselves and once we open that door, theres always something big waiting to happen and once we accomplish that another big adventure awaits.

In the history of United States, there were many people who idolized idle. I hope everyone see's how much bad impact idle is in our lives.. Technologies serve their own purpose but we have our own purpose, we are born to do something big. I agree that it is okay to not do anytime sometimes because everyone needs a break in their lives. Even small chores prepare us for something big",0
"failure taught us what were we doing wrong, and we learned from it, this shows us of how failure is related to success by trying many times to achieve what you are fighting to achieve.

Many people believe that failure is not related in any way to success, they have arguments saying that, you can accomplish something at the first try, that you do not learn anything from the mistake or the times you have failed at something, and they also say that you lose all enthusiasm when you fail numerous times at something. Failure has a enormous role in success. Many of those spaceships exploded do to problems on their systems or other problems. This is a great example of the strength that people have when they do not give up and they give all they are capable of. That is why I think that failure is related to success. we learned from this and the U.N was created to maintain global peace through nations and till present days it stills been one of societies biggest success. Former Primer Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"", and in my opinion I agree with Churchill's words. This is also a great example that shows how failure has many things directly related at helping people to success at what they are trying to achieve.

Another example of how failure can help you success is trying once more. I believe this people are wrong because you do not always accomplish something in the first try, and you always learn from your mistakes, you might learn valuable lessons out of them; their last argument can be denied by telling to yourself that you can do it, we decide when do we lose our enthusiasm or not. . this is the most important feature in the relationship of failure and success because once you have looked back at what you did wrong last time and learning from that, you are ready to try once more and accomplish what you have been fighting for. After many tries looking at what failed and what went wrong humans were able to send satellites and people to the outer space, it took many failures to till we got all of this finished, now we are able to send spaceships throughout the galaxy to explore the stars and many other places. As an example of this is the spaceships that have send to space to reach many places in the universe. this is an example of how learning from mistakes you have made in the past is useful but overall this is one of many examples you can put to show how failure is related to success.

Not giving up is also really important on this because giving up is not an answer as an example of this is, Pele, he became one of the best soccer players in history but it also became the youngest player to win a world cup, since a really small age he was told that he was never going to become a soccer player, he was told numerous time that his talent was not enough, but he did not gave up, he gave all he had and when he had the chance he showed everyone of what he was capable of and became one of the best players in the world. In his debut on first world cup he suffered an injury on his knee while training for the first match, it let him out for half of the of world cup. this is why I believe they are wrong failure is related in the pursuit of success even if we want it or not because you learn and gain experience out of it, that is what makes this world a better place, failure, and it might sound like is not true but I believe it is; failure is always there and we can always learn valuable lessons out of it.

Like I stated in my examples above failure is related to success; failure is not a bad thing because we learn from the mistakes we have done, we can gain experience out of it, we learn what are we doing wrong, but what we have to keep in mind is that we decide if we lose the enthusiasm in something whenever we decide to do it, this is why I believe that the words that Winston Churchill said are true, because from failure to failure we learn from the mistakes we made along the way to success, we can think of a better plan with the things we learned and after that we can try once more to accomplish the thing we have failed with better results that those we were expecting. Doctors told him that he had to do exercise every day to get better, but that he was not going to be able to play in the whole tournament; he did not give up he trained day after day and in the third phase of the world cup he was given an opportunity to play in one of the games. Its well known that many of the spaceships that have been send to space failed, and in really big proportions. Failure is all about, learning from the mistakes you made and gaine all the experience you can out of it, Not giving up and plan what can you do better to accomplish what you have been fighting for to get even better results that the ones you were expecting in the first place, that is what failure is all about and that is why it has big and important a role in the pursuit of success.

Learning from the mistakes that were done is a big example of the role that failure has on the pursuit of success; throughout history there had been many times were our society, nation, and specie had learned from their mistakes; as an example of this is the League of Nations, it was created after WWI to maintain worldwide peace; It end up being a big failure",0
"Technology also makes more easy to talk with people that is far away and you miss. The technology has improve this years, allows people to makes think much faster than before and the technology every day its going to keep improving. Last year I call my grandmother and she never had a cellphone before, she was surprise that she was talking to me event that she is far away from me that makes me so happy and I was thinking that if technology does not exist I dont know how to communicate whit does people that are far away from me.

Technology is very important this days, for everyone but if we used for good because their is some people that use technology to do bad thinks and that way technology have some negative effects on peoples lives. Technology makes thinks much easy and quickly for everyone, If you dont have a car you can shop online. The limitation of human contact has something to do with technology because there is some people that dont know how to use technology they think that technology is the only way and they feel like there is no other friends but that wrong because technology its a tool for human and if we know how to used its going to makes us life much easy.

In my opinion technology its one of the best tool that we have, but we have to lean how to used because it can helps us a lot and makes us much easy many thinks, but there is only one rule we have to used for good.. I think that Technology makes thighs more easy for everyone but especially for does that cant walk, speak or heard. People can buy food, materials, video games, books and everything that in necessary",0
"The benefits of working with a group and why you should find a group to complete your assignment isn ted of doing it alone.

It's really beneficial to be with a group because of everyone collaborating. Having a lot of people in a group means that everyone is going to be sharing their thought and ideas of how to complete the work in a easiest way. Working alone means that you have to work harder more responsibilities and also it will take you much more time to complete your assignments sense you are doing everything by yourself.

Being with a group allows others to collaborate with each other that means that no matter how hard the assignments are all together are going to be able to complete it. A group gives you better understanding of what you all have to complete do to everyone strong thought and ideas.

Something really important in a group is the Lieder someone who is responsible to check if everyone in a groups is done with their assigned task. Working with a group makes the assignments to be completed in a easier and a faster way. Being on a group give you a better understanding of what the work is all about do to everyone ideas, also you have less responsibilities including much less time to complete your given assignment. Also being with a group guarantee you to complete the work in much less time that if you were to do it alone. A group guarantee you success when it became to complete any assignments do to everyone effort and sharing ideas, sure a lieder might be important but with a a group the lieder is nothing so everyone is really need in a group in order to successfully complete the work.

Overall working with a group give you much more benefits that be working alone. . Also having a lieder will be easy to assign each one a task without everyone complaining about doing the work. Having a group guarantee you less responsibilities as well because you have others whom can do a different task from what you are doing. You can also contact you lieder to inform him that is going to be impossible for you to complete your assigned task do to a problem with your family so that way a lieder can inform the others and find someone who can take you task and finish it, if you were alone you would not be able to complete that sense you wouldn't have anyone to depend on",0
"I believe that changing the school lunch menu would be a good idea, there are reasons why the change of the lunch would be good idea; It can help students who are sick, It can help the students who play in a sport team, it can help those student who abuse eating at home.

First reason: healthier school lunch menu can be good for many students who does fitness and also for those who play in the school sports teams, they need to be healthier, for example soccer players needs to be with good weight, so they can play good in their games, but if they are eating things with a lot grease they would not be on the team, because they are not eating healthy.

Second reason: The change of the school lunch menu can also be good for those students who abuse eating at home, for that I think the healthier lunch menu can be a good idea, because they abuse eating bad thing at home but, they eat healthier at school, that is the second reason why I choose that the healthy lunch menu is a good idea, because the students are eating better than what they eat at their homes.

Third reason: This last reason is to show that the healthy food is better, because it helps students who are with any type of disease whether is a terminal disease or a normal disease, it doesn't matter what kind of disease can be,

it just that eating healthy help them for example, there are many student who are with diabetes sometimes they to bring their lunch from their home, because at school there nothing they can eat, because everything may have grease or sugar on it, and that is the reason why student bring their lunch, because of their disease, so that is why I think healthy food can a good option for the school lunch menu.

In conclusion, the healthier school lunch menu would be a good idea because it will help a lot students in many ways including teachers, students, and all the people who works a the school, I think is a good idea to be healthy not just out of school also inside of the school, we just want to maintain our habits, and that can be good because, we are doing the right thing, and that is my opinion about the school lunch menu, we just want to improve with the school and doing this we will.",0
"In my opinion It's a great idea to finish all of high school within 3 years because that's hard work paid off but some people believe that if you stay in school for an extra year that makes you smarter but in some sense that could be true but sometimes people stay the extra year because for 1 they sometime's stay because they fell behind and sometimes it's because they need one type of class for college but in reality the people who did the 3 year's of high school are the truly advanced one's because they did everything within 3 years and its good for them.

if these people go into the work place they have a higher chance of getting the job that they want because they have a high school diploma and the fact that they graduated school early so they that as an advantage for them when they find a job and most jobs are only looking for people that are either in high school or have a diploma because some job's just want people with brains so they could work smarter and not harder but the truth is these people are doing everything to make a living because they worked really hard in high school now they're working really hard at a job and now they are succeeding in life because they were smart and graduated earlier then everyone else

In the case that going to college after graduating the three year's are also good because they want to get into a field of a type of job that they wanted and now they're working even harder for it but in reality its working smarter not harder because they are studying for a career that will give them more money no matter what because they are studying for 4 more years to achieve there dream of becoming something in this world and they are smarter by doing that because a dream job is one of the thing's everyone want's and its good to have a goal in mind.

In my conclusion is that going to college is the better one because It's working smarter not harder and that's the better idea instead of working hard and not being able to get paid enough like the people at the college do so in my state of fact that college if the better choice to go with out of high school no matter if you did 3 years or traditional 4 years of high school the best choice is after high school to go to a college or a university that makes life better in the end for everyone. There are some some school's that offer 3 years to graduate but then there are some school's that are still doing Traditional way's of the 4 year's of high school and in my opinion is that it is good to graduate early and go to college or the work force but it also depends on the person thats doing all this work to graduate high school or the evenings or night school but people still do it and its good. Some people like to chose the route of hard work but its truly good to head to a college or university after school is over fo0r this person.. The people that are doing all this work are hard working people who want to follow through with there ideas and dreams in life and they are paying good for it by studying and working hard throughout high school and they keep on working hard to reach for there goal outside of high school",0
"money is like water you have then spend it, all gone.

Then the other choice not having a career in a young age,living their life to the fullness plus spending time with family and friends. At this point you could spend more time on studying mostly importation on yourself.

Be honest i dont think is a good idea,It take time to grow up to be young ADULT!!! Yeah sure everyone make mistaken but learn by it even if youre old,young it doesnt matter.. At that age no one knows how to spend money or mange too. you dont have to worry so much about paying bills and other things. In some societies, student are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school.

First having a career in a young age,start work (having a job) and living by yourself. Do you think is it a good idea for students to start a career at a young age under 18 or not,student should make their own choice. Your family will support you no matter what happen,you could go out with friend. its like middle school and high school switch around youre pranging to live your life as adult instead living your life as teenage",0
"You are the person who inspires us to be doctors. We would like to be a famous doctors as well as you are. I know that it is a hard dream to follow. We are actually studying to be the most knowing doctors becausewe want to be different from the others. Maybe you had a dream too, and I suppose that it was not easy to became a professional doctor. In the school we do not have the resources to have these materials. We would like to be a great surgeons.

We think that your workplace will be a great starting to know more about how to do an operation. We also would like to know a little bit more about how to be a fantastic doctor. But I just want to know a little bit about medicine. We would like to know how to become a doctor. We also would like you to show us how hard can a real job be. We are asking if you can give us the approbation to visit your hospital. I know you are a great surgeon, that is the why I am asking you to teach me. We are five students that would like to know more about how to be a doctor and how to safe lives. We are asking if you can allow us to be in a operation with you ,or be watching how do you and the other doctors work in the clinic. I know that it is not easy to be the hospital's manager and surgeon but there if you can. Dear manager

Good morning, we would like to visit your company because we are content to meet and know a little bit more about this job. Was it? So can you please make my dream true and give me the first steep to be a professional person. We want to be professional people, what is the why we want you to be our teacher in this new experience. I was thinking about if maybe you may be with us. We also choose this kind of job because it is great, even is sometimes doctors have to make hard decisions.

We know a little bit about medicine. My dream is that in a future I can have my own clinic and hospital. My dream will finally come true.

I swear that my life will be better if you let us be in there. I'll too.

Thank you for listen to me. Have a wonderful day!

Generic_Name;                                                                                                                                                                                             . We want to be like you, be a famous person. But if you gives us the chance to be in your hospital for one day. Your clinic is always clean. We choose your workplace because we think it is a great place to start meeting about medicine. We choose this job because we think it is a great job and also because you can save lives.

It will be a pleasure to meet your workplace. I know is kind of hard to ask you to let us be in your clinic because I know you are a busy person. It will be a pleasure to meet you and your hospital because we just want to know how do you work, how do you control the clinic, how do you make an operation. Be able to say, "" I did it"". We would like to be in an intensive room, even if it can be disturbing. We would like to be in your clinic one day because we want someone to show us the materials that the doctors use. We choose your workplace because of people told us that your clinic is the most amazing place to have an operation. We are also so excited to meet your workplace because some people doesn't have the opportunity to visit you and your clinic",0
It will make more people like school because you can take it online and you can finsh it at any hour but its due that day. This way if student's are really sick and can't come to school and are going to be out of school for weeks then this will help the student's keep on track with the class. A other benefit is being at home everyday and not have to move around a lot. Student's would probably have better grades because they would be finishing the work. A other reasons this is good is that student's that dont come to school a lot can stay at home while they can do the school work at home instead of go to school and not showing up. Students would focus more because they have no one to talk to during the online classes. Student's would get better information while doing this and it will come a long way in the future for them. The student's can take brakes during this time so they dont tried of doing a lot of work. It would be easy the get help if the student's dont understand they can just search it up on the internet or ask someone in their house for some help. Student's dont have to wake up early in the mornings and be tried and if Student's come to school all tried they wont do the work most of the time. If the Student's take online classes then can finish anytime without have to worried about the class finishing and not hand in an incomplete assignment. If the schools did the online classes they wont have to be worried about snow days. A other good reason is that the student's can show their mom or dad they did their work so they can do what ever they went after because most of time student's dont show their mom or dad that they have been doing work in school. This would make somethings easier for people like the people who dont like to come to school or the people who dont like to wake up early in the morning. This can also help the student's with computer skill while doing online school. It will save a lot of time for the student's and teacher's because they wouldn't have to be there the whole day at school. . Student's will benefit from take the school classes at home instead of going to the school because they could work at their own pace,0
"Students needs a lot of stuff to success in life. Plus Not working alone, I do not like to work alone in life. It's not only sharing the risks, but sharing the good stuff too. They think that the members might not get along with each other, and at the end the business will break down. People who thinks that partnership is bad they are actually wrong, but they have points though. Sharing ideas to make the profit better. I believe that all is it about is trust and happiness.

Some people might thinks that Partnership is not good. They believe that partnership business is not helpful at all, but they are wrong it is helpful. It will help students to improve their skills. Schools should have the qualities to help their students success.

Schools should have a partnership business to help all the students to reach their goals. It will also help the students to reach their goals and success in life. I don't want to lose all my money so I would be happy to have a partnership member to help me out. Having all the risk alone is horrible, for an example it can causes living in the street or losing all the money that the person have. Getting along with each other takes time, but picking the right people for the business is needed. It allow students to explore certain professions. I want to live a good life when I grow up , so I won't like to take all the risk by myself. . I would love to work with other people when I grow up.

Sharing Is one thing I like about partnership. Partnership is not about loneliness, but its about happiness. Working alone is really boring , but by talking to the members of the partnership can be really fun. Helping the students to improve their skills and give them time to improve their brains as well. Many schools have partnerships with local companies. Schools should have the qualities to help the students success in their future life. Yes, sharing is a really good thing in a partnership business. Taking the risk alone is very hard, It's as hard as touching the clouds. By doing that the members gets to know each other much more. Sharing money to grow the business. Plus having a partnership business is much easier, and

No one takes the risk alone. Having a partnership is much easier, because members helps when its needed.

Partnership is easier, because if the business doesn't work out, then everyone will take the risk not only one person. Partnership is about learning new stuff from other people, and it's the most important thing in a partnership business.

A lot of schools now are having a partnership with local companies, which is a good thing",0
"Everyday, he is so busy and he does not has times for his family and himself. When they look at another people they can learn more lessons and experiences in life. So, they force to finish it while they do not like. And he thinks it will better for the next day but the manager just gives him these jobs and no more. When they go out to work they need to follow all the rules of the life. Absolutely, he knows what he wants to do. He recognizes that help him too much to create more skills and learn more experiences.

Thus, people should not being themselves are great accomplishment. However, they live in the modern world and have many things to worries. However, not being themselves should not change the physical world. He hopes it will make his life better and can complete his dream later.

Also, sometime they need to change. For example, a man who has a dream that he can travel around the world. But when he do this job for the long times and he feels that he does not has more interest. So, we know that many people are accomplishment by their own decision but only for who are smart or brave challenge themselves. So, he will manage by the marketing manager and he so happy about that. Another lesson for that is something they hate is not mean they give up or not finish it because it is a part of testing in the life. He always thinking about it but he can not. Task is the mission from the boss give them to completing. They want to do with something else. So, people should not being themselves because they do not know exactly about themselves. For the first day, the manager just wants him to do some work likes buy the coffee, copy papers... If a person being themselves then they just want to do anything they know and do not care another person. For example, a trainee person who is young and do not have an experience in the job. Some people want to become another one to success. So, he put his dream on the side and focuses on the job. Just do the best they can and maybe they can accomplishment if not being themselves.. That make they think if they should being themselves or not. Although people have their own decision, people should not being themselves are great accomplishment because sometime they need to change and over time people have done the tasks they hate.

First of all, people have their own decision. Some of them just live and do anything they like when they success. Inside of each people always has the right and the wrong sides. Because he know it is a modern world and has many things to do and worries. For instance, a person who live with his family and he recognizes that he likes to become the doctor in the future because his family want it. After thinking about that, he wants to do the jobs that makes him comfortable and can enjoy the wonderful life.

In addition, over time people have done the tasks they hate. So, he hates it but he never give up because it is the rules of life. Also, they can not do anything they like while living with their family before. Sometimes, they need to change to know the outside of the world have more fun than if they just stay at one place. Because he just graduation and he wants to become the employer in this company. Of course, they will feel boring and nonsense. So, he knows work to lives, not lives to work. Some people they never change their life, and they just live by the rules",0
"Cristiano Ronaldo is a soccer star but he went to high school and know what the students want to do and design. He talk to us that picking our own projects is way better than teachers picking the design because we can make our own ideas and it is less stressful and that is going to be easier. Everyone keep saying that teachers should make the designs of students projects for the summer.

Students of everywhere can make there project design less stressful if they get to choose what they can do. That's why she told me that is more fun to get to choose your own design of project because when teachers get to choose them is super boring and stressful students sometimes cry. In the article he wrote that we students have a amazing brain and we can come u with the best ideas and design of projects that no one else can't. When students pick their design they don't need to worry about asking question to their teacher and stressing out. Cristiano Ronaldo wrote a article about why is good students should design their projects and why teacher should let them design their own article. School required students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break. Messi gave us a great talk about how to choose your own design of project can make every students less stressful. The mother of my friend ones told me that there is nothing more fun than getting to design a project as a student. She told me that when she was in high school their teacher choose the project for them and that wasn't fun for no student. Messi told us that when he was in high school,he used to choose his own design of project because it was less stressful and more fun to do. Teachers should let students choose their own design so students can relax and have fun over the summer and they can keep doing there project and still have time to have fun with family and friends. They make us work super hard and is super hard to communicate with their teacher over the summer. Never let your teacher choose design the summer project for the students.

While other people might say that these summer projects should be teacher designed because the student keep learning more and keep working hard;however, if students make their own summer project design it is way better because student have better ideas, less stressful, and get to have more fun while doing the project. It is better for the students to design their own summer project because they have better ideas, Can make their projects less stressful, and make it more fun with their friends.

All students in the world have better ideas to how to design your own project and make it better. It is going to be more fun if you get to choose your own design for the summer project because i can get to make it with my friends and probably family members. Students around the world have a ruff time trying to do projects that their teacher gives them over the summer. When students get to design there own project is less stressful for them because they can choose how they want to do it.

Leonel Messi came to every high school in the united states to talk about how stressful is when teacher give students projects over the summer. The time we live on right now students should get projects over the summer, so they can prepared for college and other things in life this is why the schools are giving them work so they dont forget about school and keep learning everyday. Students have better understanding of what they want to do for there project like having better ideas and knowing what they want to work on.        . While some people around the world say that teachers should design the summer project for the students. She told me that If i had the chance to make my own design to take it because it was not going to be fun to if the teacher choose the design. when people keep saying that teacher should choose our design it so stressful because us as student want to choose our design for our summer project.

People in all high schools keep saying that is more fun for students to make our design of project ,because it makes our studies more fun and incredible. Every student around the world should start making their own design for their project. He wrote on the article that students brain is still developing;he said that if students keep making their own decision and teachers let them choose their designs of projects they can come up with better ideas that other people cannot even think about",0
"I want to change how they play I don't want my country loosing a lot of game my country need to win a lot of game. I want to accomplish this because soccer is my main sport, If I had a chance to play in a professional soccer team it would be amazing. One day I will accomplish that I would be the player who change my country but not just win game, win the World Cup for the first time in History of my country. One specific team is Barcelona, Because Barcelona is one of the best soccer team in the world winning a lot of trophies. They won the champion five time, they also won ""La Copa Del Rey."" Barcelona they got a lot of good player they got Messi,pike,Ansu fati,Luis Suares, and Griezman.

I'm a Barcelona fan if I had i chance to play for Barcelona it would be a dream come true for me. And one last thing I also want to play for my country as a professional soccer player.

Because my country is not good they have lost to many other country but they haven't won any game so I want to change that. That would be a dream come true again, and then Avery person in the team is going to be happy about winning the World Cup.",0
"Secondly if you always have people telling you the answers in life it is hard to live without those people who helped you in the first place. I highly doubt that Tesla or Einstein relayed on anyone if not no one on the work that they did. Your past choices defines who are you today, so if you relay on others too much than you become a different kind of person you once were

Other people who spend their whole life heavily relaying on other people develop no self-identity of their own. That people who seek out help will be more informed in life, therefore they do not have to worry about the things they do not know. Finally always become a person who does not have to relay on others for the sake of your own well being. People should be inclined to make their own decisions in life whether they like it or not.. Lastly self-sufficiently is an important skill that everyone should have through-out their life. Another reason would be that people might think you are unable to do simple tasks in life because you relay on other people too much. Additionally if you do not have a self-identity people will not remember who you are. This may be true but it's better to find the answer on your own than to always ask for help from experts.

In the end you shouldn't rely on other people too much because it will be harder to be more self-sufficient and it will be harder to develop your own self-identity. People should make their own decisions because relying on others will make you less self-sufficient and you should develop your own self-identity not from the choices of other people, although some people may say that people who seek guidance from experts are smarter than people who do not.

People should be able to rely on their own decisions on life, so that they do not become less self-sufficient in the choices that they make. How people live their life is up to them whether to follow their own decisions, or seek guidance from experts and authorities for life's important matters. You should always listen to your brain and not seek out help too much, or it will affect your life in very bad ways

Still, some may say that people who seek help from experts are smarter than people who do not. Firstly if you keep relying on others than you become someone who can not do anything on their own without the help of other people",0
"When setting you aim high, it improves you as a person and helps with your own growth.

Not to mention, aiming high for a goal is possible when you have the right mentality.

When you aim high, the results are more motivating than when going for a goal set low. The famous artist Michelangelo once said, ""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark."" His quote implies that completing a low goal is far worse that failure. While always staying in your comfort zone, aiming low, you will be confining yourself, which prevents you from improvement. Although one may fail while aiming high, you will gain experience and knowledge from the situation.

To begin with, growth comes with attempting to accomplish new things out of your comfort zone. For instance, when working towards a goal, it comes with finding your true self. In order for growth and improvement, one must be required to step out off their comfort zone. You can learn about your interests and hobbies, or even new ideas and thoughts that come to mind. By setting goals to a higher level, we can gain experience and knowledge that comes with the path to achievement. In my opinion, I agree with Michelangelo's quote; when people aim too low, they are preventing themselves to have learning experiences. In order to succeed the next time you attempt again, you can improve your mistakes. For the fact that we need to grow as a person, we can not always stay in our comfort zone. Because aiming high comes with better resluts, it can serve as motivation to completing a goal. These people view failing as a discouragement as others may consider them as a weak.

However, aiming high and failing gives you a life-longing experience by having the chance to improve your mistakes. For instance, when achieving to graduate high school, one may aim to graduate as valedictorian. When you fail, you can use that situation to understand where you went wrong. . When attempting again, you will have gained the knowledge to do so.

In conclusion, I believe that setting our aim too low and achieving it is far worse than aiming high and failing. On the other hand, when you aim for a low mark, there is no learning lesson you may gain.

However, some people believe nothing is wrong with setting your aim low. Failing is essential to the learning process as it gives you a chance to better yourself to prevent future mistakes. Being the valedictorian comes with great results such as getting into a better college or even just feeling better about yourself. By setting goals too low, we are preventing ourselves to grow and improve. If you put your mind to it, belive in yourself, and work hard towards it you will be able to accomplish any goal.

Furthermore, failing at achieving a goal provides experience. Instead, they believe that going for a goal set too high is worse as it means it will come with failure. This knowledge you have accumulated from this certain situation, will be useful if applied to other life problems. When you set your aim high, it assists with finding out what you are truly capable of",0
"The future and the time could be creppy but you need to rememember all dreams are possible if when you keep them in mind, is not impossible to be yourself is hard ans sometimes sad when you get lost tryng to find who you are but at the end life will be good because you finally gonna be the person you wants; Because trying to be yourself in this ugly and unfear world is the greatest accomplishment, at the end nothing is more important than you.. Im completly agree with this quote, because actually is hard to be youself, a person who dont even know who him is and his proposit in this world and a society were literally nobody cares about who you are, your aspect and your skills that probably gonna be used to enrich other people who doesnt even know you. Nobody has born yo be the center of everything, even if everything looks immposible you are still able and free to be the person you wants to be even thought is hard when the world is facing you and making imposible little things,but sometimes you need to accept that somethings aint for you, nothing is just when they was maded to people with more opportunitys sometimes you will feel that you will never get a good chance to do what you actually wants. Sometimes life could be misleading and maybe will be hard to find yourself or your proposit.

even your family could have 2 faces and make your way harder, thats why you need to take care who you trust and select correctly, theres bad people and just because the blood is shared doesnt make them your family",0
"It can help you be successful and more reliable.

Instincts help you from being dependent all the time, because you won't be able to be with your friends forever. For example, If you're going on a trip with your family, and you find out that there's going to be a traffic in the morning, what will you do? Wake up early in the morning before the traffic forms. For example, those who have no sight can not see what they're doing. More ideas can be useful if you put your mind into it. That's how you use your brain. Some people don't use their common sense to solve problems, because they're afraid that they're going to make it worse. I agree, because it gives them more experience to use their brains more, it makes people develop more, and it helps you from being dependent all the time.

Using your instincts gives people more experience to use their brains more. People who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas. For example, you're in your apartment and you need to pay a bill for your car. You think and plan ahead before things go bad.

People developing more is great for your brain, because it makes you smarter and brighter. Being independent is important in life.

In Conclusion:

Some say that people who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas, because it gives them more experience to using their brains more, makes people gain more common sense, and it helps you from being around your companions all the time.

Counterclaim: Not everyone can use their common sense, because they're not born that way. It's okay to make mistakes. You're going to have to call the bank that you want to pay for that car. Those who are deaf, cannot hear the people who are talking.. Sometimes, people don't know how to be independent, or maybe they just don't want to. You have to use your common sense to help you along the way to your adulthood. Having a couple of friends is nice, but your going to have to act and deal with life yourself. Your friend does not need to tell you to pay for the things that you own. For example, if you want your boss to be impressed by you, you need to act and use your instincts to create new ideas",0
"I support that schools should follow the same model as the business model who have adopted a four day work week to conserve energy and resources, energy, and extending the school day two hours, this kind of model could make them feel better to attempt to class, and start taking action about conserving energy and and think about our future there could be a day when our energy and resource comes to a end for humanity if we dont take actions.

However they should considered that energy and resources benefits us and the world, we mostly need energy in everything to survive and resources its a natural source of wealth or revenue that enhances the quality of human life, if businesses have adopted a four day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours to conserve energy and resource for their future, my school should follow this model because i think schools are the most who spend and waste energy and resource by their thousands of students that attempt there.

With a four-day school week , student would at least get rid of depression which adds unnecessary stress, they will have a one break day to do their homework and assignments without staying up all night just to finish it, at the same time it will benefit the environment by just having a four day school week , it will be harder for them to adapt for a longer days of school and a shorter week of school, some of them will not adapt to it but still it would help them to be more time at home with their family instead of be at school stressing.

Whatever, If parents and students got the benefit of having a day off, parent will have the time that they didnt have before with their kids they will more hours of work and school but still it may help them to have a better connections, and at least they would have a day off stressing and worrying about their work and assignments.

In Conclusion, cutting one day out of school would be helpful for young teenagers who are studying and working at the same time to help their families, and it would conserve much energy and resource than before, making our environment greater by conserving energy and resource in only four days of work for adults and four days of school for teenagers who attempt to any school.

"Be able to choose a class is a good opportunity because it helps students to be intresting in new projects, know new things and obtain a good education at school. Elective classes are chosen by student who are intresting to be part of it. As a result of take an eletive class can be a tool for students to discover what subject is most important for them to have knowledge and have the passion of keep learning.

However other may say that students should be required to take a music, art , drama class because students can have intertainment having these kind of classes, but I stiil be thinking that students should be required to take an elective class because learning what they like, they put much effort to get knowledge and good grades, for example study, pay attention to what the teacher is saying participating in class or any other activity. In my positon students should be required to take elective classes because they attend to school every day, students are teach in what they want to learn and students are much success in class.

Many students do not attend to school in order to not have a clase that they do not like. Moreover obtain good results of what they decide to choose to become a successful student.

Students who take elective classes have the advantage of learn what is interesting for them , and be succsess no just in class also might be helpful for students in a future. In some school people had heard that many students are teach In things that may not be needed in life like art, some students take art because they like that clase and problably because In the future they Might be plaining to become an art teacher, but for others is preferable to select an elective class that will manage her/ him to be succsessful. Obtaing a good education might encourage students to be succsessfuly in other classes and in other places.. Many students

Probably prefer to have a elective clase because they are learning what they like, and will be less difficult for them to understand the class. Furthermore if students have an elective class they will have that exicitement to start the class on time and not be late, neither to miss school any day because of their interest of learning .

Students should be guide in what they may think is useful and much helful for them. Students that use to not attend school is when he/she have a class that is not intresting to learn; they may think that the class is not important enough to help them in a future, and letting students to take elective classes probably will stop the absence of many kids because they will want to know new things about the class ",0
"There was a time in my family where we had a problem of money, my father got fired on his work, we almost lose the house where we were living, because we did not paid the rent in almost four months. He really change since that days, that many of us, we are still working there, and earning more money than we regurlarly earned.

In every human life, there is always a hard problem, that make us to give up, but there is also a person with a positive attitude that makes us to get up, and continue with our life. After that many student changed their attitude, but it was not because we wanted. We paid more attention as we should since the beginning of the year, we started to believe in us, we started to do things even if we didn't know how to do it. For that experience that I had, I think that possitive attitude is something extremely important in every human life.

Our attitude has to be always positive, even in the worst moment of our life.

Some people think that a person should have a positive attitude just during a very important moment, or in happy moments, this is not correct, they all are wrong, we need to have a possitive attitude always in order to succeed in life, and to be happy. When I was in 10 grade, I had an algebra teacher that was always telling us that we had to believed more in ourselves, sometimes we did not do what she asked us to do, because we did not understand, many of us were disappointed of ourselves, because we didn't even try to do it. That is why until this moment she is one of my favorite teacher, and I think that for my other classmates she is too. My father was devastated, he was looking for a job amost for three months, and he could not find any job to pay the rent, so we would not lose the house. We though that our score would never change. So, that same day I asked him if we may talk, he said "" Yes"", I just wanted to talk with him and tell him that perhap everything, we were there to support him in everything he needed. As every wife do, my mom came to him and said ""Do not worry sweetheart, we can get out of this problem as we always do, I am here to support you"". In the first quater many of us in our class period failed. Unfortunate, his wife pass away, and as I said to him, we were there all the time supporting him, we were there with a positive attitude telling him, that everything will be okay, that his wife is gonna be in a better place where can rest in peace, where she will not suffer more. Some time later many of us had changed, as we changed, we saw that our teacher changed too. My father almost immediately changed his attitude, he gave to my mom a big smile and said to her "" Thanks babe to be always with me, and for trust on me"", he get up take the keys of the car, and went out to look for another job. There was one day that he had a bad day, because one member of his family was in the hospital, and was very delicate, he was an a mood that did not look like he was the same one, he was sad, he was devastated, and worried, because the person that was in the hospital was his wife, she had cancer. He found a new job where he earn a little bit more than his previous job, so our money's problem disappear.

Believe in yourself not always is easy, some times we though that is difficult to understand yourself, but there is always a lovely person that help you to believed in how strong you are, and to see all the thing that you are capable to do. We changed, all of us did, and she became for me the most good person as a teacher and as a friend, she was always supporting us, and teaching us. He was so thankful with us because how we supported him in that bad moments that wanted to increase our salary, many of us accepted, but many others not. In our homes old people as grandmother, grandfather, sibblings and parents, need to give the example, so kids will take it, and they will be confident and a positive person.. The second quater passed, and the students were happy because their score in the algebra class, many students's score were from 50 to 90, it happened because all us changed our attitude in different manners. In my opinion attitude should be always positive, because it can help you to succeed in work, can encourage people to do their best, even if what they have to do is hard to do it, and it can be a great tool in order to succeed in relationships, and believed in yourself.

When I was working in Mango Paradise, my boss was a really bitter person, that was always angry with everyone in the work, but I was one person that I didn't care about his bad attitude toward us, I was always with a big smile, perhap how he treated us. It was because our teacher talked with us, and made us to believe that we can do anything that we want to do. Until this moment I am thankful with my teacher, because of her, we changed to a better score, because of her we believe more in ourselves, she just wanted our best, but sometimes we made her get angry, because we did not believed in ourselves. Do you think positive attitude is a key that everyone need in order to be a successful person in life? In my essay I will talk about positive attitude, if it is important or not",0
"You don't have to change yourself to prove a point to someone. Be yourself dont be that person that tries to back to him or herself just because you dont like the now you. You decide to change to be a better person so move on and keeping that person you wanted to be at one point. Trying to go back to that person you used to be can be long ago by the time you try to change back to that person. One thing my grandma would say to me is "" sweetie be yourself don't change yourself for anyone because no one will respect you and love you like your family will"". Changes can reflect you as to what goes on in your life. Sometimes its good to change in your life but don't loose the way you are to be someone worse because your attitude and personality is what stands out the most in you. Just by being yourself could always reflect on who you want to be once you grown up and leave from your families home.. Who you are now could help you throughout the rest of your life. You've changed for a reason so now you should em braise it and love your change. Be you don't push your inner self away because no matter how rude and annoying you are your still one of the best person in your family. No matter how mean, rude, disrespectful you are you can't really change the reason I say that is because that is how you are already as a person. Who you chose to be will be that same person you'll possibly be one you are more grown into life.

Lastly; be yourself and dont try to change yourself to be someone your not. You had already been trying to be someone that you like or maybe even respect. Just by being yourself and pushing yourself to change can be such a big change in your life even maybe to your family that are already used to you being a certain way. Most people can bring you down just by talking about you are even getting other people to hate you maybe because your to quite or your not a good person. Being yourself brings out the better you in a person. Be the person that stands out for being himself or herself and not the one that everyone says oh they copy everything

I get or ever wanted to be more popular somewhere be more known as a person.

Fourthly; Changing back someone you had already change to can be difficult because you had already pushed away the person you didnt want to be. If you want to change you should do it for yourself don,t do it for your friends because at the end of the day they won't care who you are or what you are. When you are yourself your a better person because your not changing yourself to be someone your not. Just by being yourself you should care about what other people think about you because you are who you are and no one can change that.

Secondly; just by changing you can loose your inner self. Most of who you are and what you do can reflect you as a person of good. Most of the people that pushed away from you now may never come back because of you changing who you are and or were at one point. Do everything to try and be your own and unique person all at one because a lot of people would like to around you. Show your inner person because you are probably hiding someone you haven't brought out yet. Don't be someone you'll eventually regret being because that could reflect on you changing. No one deserves to be changed just because people think your not a good person already. Most changes can occur maybe from someone loosing another person like they passed away and it hurts you so much you loose yourself as a person. The way someone is shows the kind of person you are and to try to change back to the person your not anymore could be difficult because you are changing your ways as a person.

Firstly; being yourself means you are unique in your own way. No one wants to b friends with someone that he or she is better than everyone else because thats not true. One reason i could say is because most of those things show that you dont care about what people think or say bout you because everyone stands out as who they are. You also can't be a coward just because someone gives you advice on changing the way you are because maybe they are trying to help you be someone better and of good. Like maybe you suffer from abuse, violent actions, or even depression that can change you as a person. You should always show where you come from even if you are poor and dont live in such a beautiful house. Most people change because they want to be a better person or they are tired of being so quiet and keep to themselves. If you want to change your way of being change to be someone better the who you are now because out don't want to be the person everyone talks about. If one of your friends, cousins, siblings stops talking to you dont bring out a mean person you weren't supposed to be because they could pull away from you and not want to be near you again. Be you unique in your own way and show everyone that you are good with who are already.

Thirdly; your personality shows your character as one. Maybe not always be yourself but dont do it or someone that doesnt deserve to see a change in you do it for yourself. Most of things you did to change yourself can just now affect you and can never be out back together again",0
"However, some may say that teens can do what ever they want, they are wrong because teens need to be taught life lessons. When taking any kind of test people will want to be successful. My mother told me not to hang out with other teens that will cause trouble. From the courage that is given to them then they will keep running till the finish line. For example, when running a relay race and you start to fall behind. For example, I was not confident on passing the SOL and my teacher was praising me to be positive and not to over think it. For example, when I was younger I steal from stores with a couple of friends. Like a good friend once said ""never let anyone put you down always get right back up on your feet"". This is saying that people should believe in their self more than what other people say about them that will drag them down. This shows that courage can praise someone to keep going.

Finally, many young teens should trust what adults say to them and not ignore them. To when having to play in a sport people will want to win and not quit. This show that when someone praises another person that they will have confidants in their self.

Second, courage can be helpful in over coming fears that can drag one self down. People end up giving up and saying in their head I lost there is no way to catch up because Im all ready in last place. People will want a friend to cheer them up and encourage them not to quit and to keep fighting. She later then told me that I should believe in my self more. Then it came to the SOL, and when I finished it, the next day my teacher told me that I had passed. Also to listen to people that are there for others no matter what. People need to have thick skin to block all the negative haters and disbelievers because having courage, confident, and trust can help with self-esteem.

First, people need to be confident in their self in order to fallow what they want to achieve in life. This shows that by praise from adults, teens will make good choices that wont get them punished.

In conclusion, praises can be very helpful for a person to feel good about their self. True self-esteem dose come from praising someone to keep going and to follow their dream. Which I didnt listen to her and we got caught by the workers and they called our parents to come pay for the belongings we stole. This shows that having courage, confident, and trust can help with self-esteem.",0
"you can travel, visit a lot of places you don,t know and want to go there or you can just relax at your house watching movies, series or shows that you like to watch.

In conclusion i think having breaks is a good idea because you can relax, go out and spend time with your family and friends, and do a lot crazy things. students enjoy summer like everyone else. in my opinion, i'm a student and i would love that my school give us a 3-4 weeks off summer break, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. Yes, it would be nice for students to have a 3-4 of break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. in summer is always sunny outside, you can go to the beach, play soccer with your friends and brothers, you can do skateboarding .you can do a lot of things in summer.

In summer you can got to different places with your family. because you get busy doing your homework and studying.

Summer is the best part of the seasons. when you're in school you don't get a lot of time to spend with your family. so that i can relax, go out with my family and friends, and do a lot off crazy things.

In summer we go to different places with my family, we like to travel, we go to crazy water parks, museums, and we go to the zoo sometimes.                                   ",0
"You might as well relate to their experience that maybe you did not even know you could relate to.

Sharing wisdom with somebody is always a good idea. And she had to do so much work and that was not easy for her every day. Judgment is part of learning to never judge somebody whether its wrong or right.

To succeed from that experience to do better, to learn and to know that from that experience you can succeed and keep in mind what to do good.

Its a good thing to learn from experiences. Its important to learn from the experiences of others whether its a good experience or a bad experience.

My mom told me once that it was hard for her to go to school and that was all because she was the women of the house. Having to cook for many other people and do work for school was really hard even when she would try to do her best it was not easy for her.

Knowledge, Judgment, and Succeed are part of experiences from others as well you might have that in yourself.        . Knowledge to know and keep in mind that maybe that person you learn something from put so much effort into it or maybe not. I think it helps people to improve and succeed and learn from mistakes and learning new and different things.

In other words, sharing your experiences with somebody brings a connection between you and that person.

Sharing your experiences and what you had to go through and knowing the other person know that it was not easy to be successful, there was a lot of work done to put on to be able to succeed",0

"My father would make me say please and thank you. In closing my father taught me how to do business and how to process one because I want to do business.

In conclusion a person who has showed me wisdom and experience would be my father by teaching me to respect adult and how to do paper work at his job. A person who has shared wisdom or experience with me would be my father ,because he has showed me how to be respectful to adults and show me how to work some business papers.

One thing that my father had shared with me is how to respect adults. They thought he was trouble child, Soon when I was born ,and when i was able to talk and walk my. As well as listening to the adults, bow when entering a door and greeting them. My dad has to count the money that he was getting and how much to give back the workers. H+e had showed me by telling about his past and show how to mange a business when I am older. Has there been anyone in your life that shared any wisdom or experience with you? If not, why not ask someone that is important to you? They would love to share maybe a dad, mom ,grandparents they have tones of experience in the past. So a few times my dad would come into my room and teach me how to split the money they were making and pay the bills. For example, my father wasn't always the best child. But as he got older he realized no one though he was serious and rejected him. Those days he showed me showed me how much money everything is ,and made me realized that I need to work very hard because if I want a simple job that I doesn't do much that gave a job that can pay my bills I need to work hard in school. This shows that my father gave me some experience to get respected into the family.

Another thing that my father has shared with me is how to work at a business. This shows that my father really cares about my future and want me to do well in life and showed me some wisdom in of how hard like will be if i don't do well in school. My father did not want me to me like him when he was younger so he made sure I was respectful to my grandparents. For instance for the past few months my father has showed me how to do paper work at his second job. So what are some people that is important to you that has shared wisdom and experince? Or what experince and wisdom would you share to people other people?                                                                    . He would do bad choices like going out with his friends all the time and not listen to this parents",0
"But, the teacher caught him cheated on the test by using the notes because his answers was exactly as the notes said. It helps me counting the money faster and also it helps me improve my positives toward the other people.

Many people disagreed that setting our aim low won't help us to achieve our goal because sometime lying could be good for some reason and achieve the goal very easy. However, the other are spreading lies to people how they achieve their goal easily and convincing people to be like them. Sometime people starting at the lowest score to the highest score because they are doing their best of abilities to get the what they wanted to.

In conclusion, starting at the lowest point to the highest point will help you figure out what you need to do or learn in order to reach the goal. However, many people are cheating to get the their goal so easily. So, I started to stay after school with my teacher and asking questions because I want to make sure that I understand the lesson. For example, if you don't try your best to achieve your goal and it's the worst thing that you could've ever done. However, that didn't work out a lot as I expected because the assignment was different from what my teacher was explaining to me. But, keep trying your best and never give up to achieve your goal; then, you can get what you want.. However, many others are lying or cheating to get a better score and failing down slowly. I agreed that the greater of us lies and not in setting our aim high or low, but setting our aim too low will achieve our mark because many people around us are down and falling for some reasons. She also said that it will helps me learn more things about the world. During the summer break, I told my mom that I want a new computer because my old computer is glitching and broken down a lot. So, it's not a shame that you are failing at something; but, it's a more worst that you lie to people and start falling down.

Also, setting our aim low will help us achieve the goal because many people are working-hard to get what they want. So, I started to work at a small restaurant and my position was cashier. Then, she told me that I work to earn money and get the new computer. I used to failed my math class last year because I didn't understand the unit because it's was too hard for me. But, I did not give up yet so I decided to study more at home and do some research about the lesson. But, they are trying their best to climb up to the top in order to achieve their goals and learning from their mistakes. The teacher was wondered how did he got a high school on the test because he was the only one who got the highest score in the class, then he lied to my teacher that he studied a lot last night. However, once the people find out that you're lying to them then you know the consequences. And I finally understood the lesson. In fact, many people are working-hard to accomplish the goal that they want to achieve.

Setting our aim too low will achieve our goals because people have a weakness in their job and that's the reason why that they should be trying their best to fix their mistakes. My best friend got a high score on the test because he cheated and the test was hard as well. No matter how hard the work is, but what's important is that I put my time and efforts on it.

Another reason why setting our aim too low will help us achieve the goal is that by trying your best and work hard for it in order to achieve",0
"Only if it is for the good. One should never allow someone to change you.

To be yourself is the best way to the greatest accomplishment because people try to persuade you or talk to you about doing something else that doesn't impressed you. Sometime people try to change you because they thought you couldn't succeed with what you wanted to become or wanted to accomplish. If you know that you going to succeed in life then that amazing because you believe in yourself . You can help them out by saying "" what you doing is not a great decision, you should have better choices then getting into trouble."" Another example, is if someone is having a difficult time, you could help them by giving them good advice how to accomplish something.

Being yourself lead to great accomplishment. Are you happy with your self? Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" Do you agree or disagree with this statement? I agree with this statement, being yourself and not letting people change you is a great accomplishment. I agree with this statement. Most of the time people gives wrong advice to others. Most of time people doubt others.        . Sometimes being yourself doesn't goes as plan as you thought it going to go. You don't have to listen to what other people say and tell you. You have to believe in yourself, that you can accomplish greater thing just doing what you admire.

Go with what you think its a good decision for you, either being by yourself or need someone to tell you what to do. You have to actually think about what you actually want to do to accomplish in life. Go with that decision that you think is right and don't allow nobody to make you do something that you don't think is wrong.

However, there are people who think allowing someone to change you can be an accomplishment. In my decision being yourself and actually knowing what to do is the best decision to the greatest accomplishment. Having a strong feeling that being by yourself is a good decision for you, that a good thing because thats means you have no problems of being by yourself. For example, if someone is having a hard time being a good citizen and they are always getting into trouble, then yes changing them is a good thing",0
"                  . Many people believe that self-esteem comes from achievement.

They believe that the source of true self-esteem is achievement.

True self-esteem comes from achievement because accomplishing a goal pushes you to try harder, help you praise yourself, and it is a long lasting satisfaction for you to remember.

Accomplishing a goal pushes you to try harder.

This is important because achievements comes from all your goals you have accomplished and that helps you want to try harder and to achieve many other goals you might have that you want to achieve.

This helps you build self-esteem by making you feel good for what you have accomplished.

Also since it makes you feel good it helps you want to accomplish other things because it makes your self-confidence grow stronger.

Also achievement helps you praise yourself.

What this means is praising yourself inspires you to continue to do many other things.

Praising yourself keeps you wanting to keep on achieving your goals.

It is like an inspiration because you know that after any achievement you are going to praise yourself and that is going to make you feel good.

So praising yourself makes you have a higher self-esteem by helping you feel good within yourself.

Moreover, achievement is a long lasting satisfaction.

For example, you have jsut achieved a goal you've had for three years now it makes you feel very satisfied that you finally made it.

Eventhough some may think satisfaction on something you achieve is not important you should because satisfaction with yourself makes your self-esteem go up.

satisfaction is a result of an achievement and a achievement helps you be more confident with yourself.

Achievement is the key to higher self-steem because it pushes you to try harder, helps you praise yourself a little more, and it is a long lasting satisfaction for you to remember.

If you want to have higher self-steem then achievement is the key",0
"So, we need to have most confidential and generous in yourself because you have be sure the yourself nobody to compare to someone else so because you are not good person.

In conclusion. Be yourself is something that's why people in the community don't respect because if yourself have to be accomplishment that's mean the you have something error. I will agree with this topic I thing that can you be yourself is something can you be on our person and you most constantly our personality so you can be greafull with something you do in your life to be nice person in the future you have to respect to be good person.

First, I thing that be yourself is something can you do in person because if you don't do that so you cannot be good person in your life. This is my reason why you have be yourself because you most have constantly our personality so you can be greafull with something you do in your life to be nice person in the future you have to respect to be good person.. However, you most have nice personality and good respect to someone be yourself and if someone don't have affect so that person is not have good personality.

Another reason. We can do the people don't do like have good and respect to someone you have to be most confidential in yourself because you most be great person to another people in the community that mean you can have make sure people is good with that to be yourself.

Next. People can do anything to constantly to another people so that's why we need to have most confidential to make sure we need to be kind because that we need yourself to be cleanly and most respectfull and generous be to good person in the future.

"I think curfews do keep teenagers out of trouble and it helps them sleep on time because after those hours a lot of law breaker are on the streets and something bad could be happening outside or on the streets like gang fights , shootings , robbers , durg dealers, drunk drivers and many more. And another example a teenager has a game he does not sleep early and he wakes up tried and is not able to play the game as well as he could.

Curfews could also help teenagers mange their time appropritely and how they spend the day for example a teenagers has a project or a home work the curfew time will help know what he/she must do first before he/she have some free time and goes to sleep.

In conclusion adopting the curfew idea would be good because it will keep the teenagers out of trouble and help them mange their time appropritely.. while it would have been better with the curfew in place.

Curfews help teenagers go to sleep on time well like on the weekdays when they got school the next day and sleep on time and wake up on time and be refreshed for a test or something for example a teenager has school the next day and since he does not have a curfew he sleeps late and he misses the bus and forgets he has a test that day. m and it would be better to stay inside in those hours than to go outside and for example a teenager is walking home from a friends house late in the midnight and gets in a fight with gang member and gets shot. The first reason is shootings mostly happens at night late after 10 p",0
"But this can be really expensive for some people a decent plan of data can cost up to fifty dollars per month, that's more money than it should be but somehow people are addicted to this. Ordering food online its a normal thing nowadays, people rarely go out to eat because of the food service, this is keeping humanity from doing any physical activity but its way easier to get something done. The best way to avoid ciber bullying is by not paying attention to whatever the other person has to say and walk away, focus on yourself and don't look back that's how life works.

In multiple situations kids enjoy watching something online than playing outside, but kids are not the only one who are being affected by this problems adults are also in the similar problem. Technology has been a really good source of information for the past years people find technology the best way to communicate, relax, plan, search stuff by using the internet. My family orders food every night without going out of the house, and it's becoming a problem because theres no effort in that. This can improve human society in many ways by making life more easy, even kids nowadays are using different sources to find something fun to do or watch for example on the platform YouTube kids can find toys reviews or cartoons which its fine but that's also keeping them from playing outside.

There are a lot of problems in society now days one of them is ciber bullying, this can drive to many problems some people take it too seriously and that can start an argument,and some people can feel offended for other people opinions this can cause a big impact in those who are really sensitive in fact there are many cases when this drives them to commit suicide, for unlimited reason people get bullied everyday but its our decisions how you can take the respond. Phone updates can also help in many ways in your life Apple realized the group FaceTime not too long ago now up to four people can talk at the same time no matter where they live, this can help the plans for your future a bussnies project a wedding or a party this is life changing, this is the future.. By not doing any physical activity the body starts gaining weight and it can be critical if the person does nothing to stop it, by simply doing more outside activities people can get a better chance to experience more things in life as going to beach, play a sport that you haven't played before or going out shopping that's can be life changing for some people including my community.

Mobile devices are improving in a incredible speed in the past five years, nowadays it's way easier to find a place by using the GPS on a mobile device, this can also allow people from other countries to contact relatives from another country by making a simple phone call or a text",0
"Failing does not mean that your to dumb to do whatever it is. You should be proud of failing cuz you know what you did wrong and next time make it twice as strong. Failing with the same feelings and mindset is hard but you just have to think failing is a way of getting better. This is what makes you try again. It is also fine to fail just get up and try again. However, its hard for people to think in this way becuase they think once they fail its all over. NO! For example Churhcill says that ""success consists of going from failiure to faliure without loss of enthusiasm"". Surely, if Churchill was a live today her would be spreading the same message around the world. Not everyone in the world is perfect. Churchill bleieves that failure has an important role in the pursuit of success. Then you try again and again until you get something you are happy with. Its not over until you want it to be over. Also, that everyone has failed at something, nobodies perfect.

Churchill Is trying to say that faliure turns in to success. You get a lot out of failing thats why i think that anyone that is going through something tough don't give up so easily becuase its is ok to fail. That without failiure there is no success. Keep trying and Try your hardest.. I beleive you can only succeed in something that you have failed at. This is what makes you find and fix your problems. Which I encourage everyone to do.

When you fall get back up everyone falls. Failiure is the key to success. Why are people scared to fail? Is failing really a bad thing. Life is about taking risks and failing. Without failing life would be boring and everything would be the same because people are taking riks we have lots of different things in the world today. It just means you need some more time. Failiure is also not something you should be afraid of or embarressed of. I wrote this to persuade my readers to take risks. Failing is a good thing not a bad. I agree with him. I believe that to have success in life you have to go through failiure. Without failing you can't really call it success. Which in my opinion evryone should do. Everyone has failed to do something. Which I also believe this becuase once you fall all you want to do is get right back up. Once you fail you know what you have to do to get yourself back up",0
"Be different from others, never let others tell you cannot do it. Must people dont like to see you accomplishing your goals, they feel unless because you did try, even if they told you you couldnt do it. If we are not the ones that help others who else is going to do it. We can achieve many goals by making things work the way we want it. By starting on making an effort, and changing life's we can help homeless. Because if we do it we accomplish more, and we feel honored to see someone else happy for what we been doing or accomplish our goal. Help others and you will have done many things for the future of someone. It must be difficult, but we can change someone else's life. We can do it even if they let you down telling you, you can not do it. Accomplish what ever you want in life to be successful, and if we are always doing something we will get to where we want to go.. It is fantastic when you achieve your goals, because you can see the effort you put to get things done.

Help homeless who does not have food or somewhere to live. And we do accomplish more when we are always doing the things we have to get done. You will be successful when you accomplish your goals, or helping others. Give back what you receive and be kindness.

It determine that you can change someone else life. And whenever you need help someone will help you back. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". We accomplish more when we do good things for people that really needs it. It helps you a better person.

Theres a lot of people in this world that feel unless, because they think that they can do anything, we can help them. We can do it ourselves to see the different in the things or gaols in this life.

In my conclusion, you must help others because whenever you need it they will help you back. It determine your personality, and helping others may recompense yourselves. You must have the enthusiastic on getting things done. This prompt was written by Thomas Jefferson, he wrote a quote on how we can have a lot of things done, when we put the effort to do it."" Determine never to be idle... It feels satisfactory on changing life's, making things go other way for others. Sometimes they feel like they dont have no one. To make a lot of things work, and to make sure were helping others",0
"I like to do my job being myself because that way I would see how I am doing and what do I have to do better.

In conclusion, being myself is a good way to see what I am good in and how I can get experiences in many different thing, I can learn more about the world and learn more about me. According to Emerson's statement and what he wrote, which is about to be myself in a world would make me something else and it will be the greatest accomplishment. For example, I like the way I am and being happy, I like to be a person with positive thoughts. It makes me feel honest to myself and everyone else.

Another reason why I am agree with this statement is because being myself I can develop many good ideas and I can share those ideas with everyone, I can do a good job and accomplish all what I want. Also, I can show to the world that being myself would make me see that I can do more than I think, I can develop many good idea about life and how to build my future making good choices, which ones will make me feel good about what I am accomplishment.

One reason why I am agree with this statement is because being myself make me feel confident about what I am doing and how I can make it better. I like to demonstrate people that I can do good and make them feel proud of me of all the thing I can accomplish by my own. It will make me get really good experiences in life which will help me to be an unique person and honest with myself.

Second reason why I am agree with Emerson's statement is because when I be myself I feel comfortable with me, I can demonstrate that being myself I can make good choices to be a better in the world, I can show many things which I would feel proud of. It would make me see the world in a different way which one will help me to do the right things and also it would make be a strong person in this world.. For example, I like to be myself when I have to present any project at school or at my job, I feel good to be myself and that way I explain it, I am confident with what I am presenting. I am totally agree with his statement because there are many thing I can do well. For example, when I talk with somebody, I like to speak with the trust and share what I think",0
"Colleges with large mass of land may not have enough parking space for students and we also believe that, not every student own a car or any type of moving vehicle where by one needs to park. Financial issues has become one of the problem in this generation of mankind, whereby students either have to pay to live on campus or out of campus to further their education,which has caused a lot of students out of school dorms because, they struggle to pay for them. They get to ask questions online, they also get more time to go over the lesson again to the right state of understanding the lesson. Most students have daily jobs to help them afford to pay the bills, based on their level of education. when one is being able to attend classes from home, they get the chance to begin their lesson anytime during day after a long stressful day.

Students benefit from being able to attend classes online from home because, they accomplish more and get worked done faster in due time. Lecturers reduce a lot on online students with less work and projects for them to have be ready for other assignments being given to them.

Taking classes online or video conferencing gives one enough to take care of other things, to be on time for lectures, help other students that couldnt go to college to feel they also have the right to achieve their goal once in a life time and to help others without transportion save money and more organised and time managment.. Working and schooling is a difficult task on students because, one have to make time for school and work to be able to make everything easier and stress free.

Transportation and parking space has also been an issue for some reason, why some students prefer to take online classes from home to prevent them from being late to class. Taking classes online or video conferencing is one of the best way to help students,who can not afford to go to college and for older people that couldn't get the chance to further their education because of their financial state. With less distractions, they understand and enjoy the lesson, it helps them concentrate and more focus on what is being taught to them",0
"As a result of this mistake the food obtain a different flavor, but of this failure I can learn and upgrade my skills like a chef.

Another example could be: when a student fail in a test, but has the chance to take a retake, is there when the student spend all their time studying to get a better grade. If you are negative, you never will be happy again, because you will stay thinking in the failure you had. Also we can take with enthusiasm this kind of failures and learn from them. A characteristic of the humans is that we try to overcome all the challenges that we have in our life.

The failures teach us how to be a best person. That a mistake don't stop you of achieve your goals. Let me tell you something else, I don't know a lot of english and I'm taking this test that have to be in english. Daily the people commit diverse mistakes, but depend of us to determine if this mistakes will define us. I'm bringing all of me to get a good grade, what I mean with this. I'm telling you all this, because I had this kind of problems previously.

In conclusion, don't let to the failures defeat you. The people just have to be more optimistics and see the failures from a good point of view. If you are negative, is very probably that you will start to have bad thoughts about yourself. Don't give up, we have to be strong. Or you want stay in the same place, with the same problems forever? No, right? You have to figth to overcome all the challenges that will appear in your life, and remember never give up. You have to be strong and learn of them, to be a best person in the future. If you are negative with a failure or mistake, let me tell you that maybe you will loss the battle with yourself. For example: When I try to cook something to eat, sometimes I forgot to add an ingredient. Nobody is perfect in this life, at contrary all the people make mistakes. The success is achieve something, is like a goal that we want reach. Well, even if I don't have a good grade, I learn many things that will help me in the future. I will not let the failure defeat me again, I will return more strong and with more knowledge.",0
"For example, ""those people who decide to marry and separate from their actual family, during time they become learning to how survive with out help of their family and they willing that they can value for themselves."" Some people demonstrate that they are independents for their actions. Some people try to accomplish themselves to demonstrate that they not need someone else to be successful. Those people who believe in individuality became more independent. Some people rather be individuality because they didn't like the opinion of others.

To begin with, People learn how they can be value for themselves. ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you someone else is the greatest accomplishment.""-By Ralph Waldo Emerson. Those people believe that be individual is a bad idea because they say that two person have more ideas than one. Some people believe that believe in themselves is more accomplishment than believe in another people. Be individuality make people more believable in their selves and be positive in their own decisions.

In conclusion individuality make people be themselves and they can effort to be the greatest accomplishment. For instance, ""When people make thing for themselves they believe in them and being positively."" Some people believe that is more better be individuality because they believe in what they do that what the others' do. Being individuality people became to learn many things. Some people be individuality because they are more believable for themselves. However, that is not true because be individual make's people to believe in themselves and also is the greatest accomplish to keep believing than what others' believe for us. To be ourselves teach as how confront our mistakes and how to process them.

secondly, Be individual make people more believable in themselves. In addition for some people to be themselves is the most greatest accomplish because people learn how they can value for themselves and demonstrate that they can be something else without help of someone. Those people who are believable in themselves are people who truly want to be successful in their life because when people are individuality they do things for their own and they realize that they are not depending for someone.

In the other hand, some people argue that is not good idea to be individual. Some people effort to do their best and not be dependent for someone. People do not need be with a partner to demonstrate that they can do many things for themselves.",0
"In the town I lived you only used to get water for 2 hours of the day and not every day. I was in fourth grade by the time I could comprehend almost what everyone was telling me and all the kids became my friends even the ones who had bullied me a year ago. I had struggles with my homework a big struggle my stepdad would come from work late and stressed out and he would not have much patience while helping me with my work and I would say I learned the language because I needed to become independent as soon as possible because it was too much stress on my back not being able to do anything on my own.      . I was born in Generic_City 2006 and moved to Generic_City I grew in a town where snitching and getting into peoples life is a daily routine because people don't finish school bacause they are lazy and others who work to feed their family and never get an education and if you get to finish everything there arent many job options to enforce your career or to make money for yourself so you have to travel to the larger cities for work and you only get paid for day not by hours unlike the US.Everybody tells you to go to the US but everyone gives up because getting paper is super hard and stressful, the chance for you to get accepted are low so people just stay and get a job at a small store until they die and it is sad because they can't reach all the goals they wish they could achieve in such a developing country.

Since I was 4 years old I wished to always go to the US because at that age I already knew I had no future back there and I used to watch tv a lot and the US looked like a promising place to live at and there we're more job opportunities and I could be what I wanted thats what everybody told you back in Generic_City, and some of it was true you get more chances to be what you want and not end up as a ""vago"" and not be a blockhead. Water is something that lots of developing countries may not have while others have it for their wet weather and jungle like land where it always rains. I came to a whole different world where the school system was different even a math problem was different than what I used to learn back there I was 8 when I came.

Something I really like i the fact that there is snow here in the US because there was no snow where I used to live, as well as water I noticed that there was water everyday and all night here in the United States. My first day of school I got in trouble in less that 1 hour and 27 minutes into the day, because some kids decided to bully me and thought I wouldn't say a word because I didn't know how to even say good morning in english well this all happened inside the hallway bathroom I beat them up because I totally forgot fighting was not allowed in the schools and they said ""He started it he was trying to hurt us we we're just trying to use the bathroom and he came out of nowhere"" and I got in trouble I wanted to say something but I only knew one word in english which was ""hi"". But you know you have to go there because the education is not well supported by the government, and the president is corrupt and does not care about its people in your country so that is your option to be something in life. My school was Generic_School which I used to get taken out of my class for a teacher to teach me english she told me I was the fastest english learning student she had in her entire career as a teacher which I was already starting to speak the language 6 months into the year with no background of me speaking the language in Generic_City. People used to say the language was their biggest obstacle even my mom said the same thing well I never thought I would come to the US of A I guess until my mom met my stepdad who brang us here but before comeing we spent a whole month and more on papers before coming to the US.It took a lot of money, work, and time which was the reason I did not want to come to the US because it frustrated me seeing my mom stressed out about some papers that we needed to come here where I now stand.

Once I came to Virginia my mom, and stepdad told me to work hard because the language would be my struggle as well as his when he came to the US around 20 years ago. Imagine you are going to a diffferent country, and you do not know anything about that country or how it works and you have only heard people talk about it or may have seen it in movies. It is good to hear what other people have to say even their personal opinions because you may never realize that you may be in their position in the future struggling.

Knowing as a kid that you have to listen to adults, but you may think it is not neccessary, I have thought the same thing before I was a teenager and before coming to the USA from Generic_City only knowing 1 word in the new language that you are going to be using the rest of your life everyday",0
"Once someone told me,"" Focus on your goals, and keep focusing until you reach them, it does not matter if it takes long, at the end of the day it will worth it "". You will be busy in a productive way doing things that will benefit you in school, because if you really wanna reach your goals you will not have chance to waste your time,

which is a good thing, instead doing nothing, bad thing, or only in video games. As how we are today, many teens are leaving school because maybe they think they found a better thing to do or because they took a bad decition.

But for those who really wanna be someone in the future and go for it, will have more opportunities, like Univercities credits and in their future job by dedicating their interest in school and doing their best.

Another reason is that your knowledge is gonna increrase, which is also a good thing, because you will learn a little bit about everything. All those are benefits that you can get by dedicating your interest in school.

In conclution, I think all students should have an idea of what career they wanna take, by the time they enter high school , so their courses of study in high school can help them when they are ready to go to the University, to not be difficult learn about it.. It could be difficult if at the end of the day you are about to gratuate and you do not even know what career do you wanna take.

One of the reasons why you have to decide what career you wanna take by the time you enter high school is that, you will focus in all your classes, but more in those classes that are related with your career, and you progress in school is gonna increase, and also your grades. In any career, you have to know about everything, even if it is a little bit, but you will learn new interesting things every days, things that you did not know before, and your interest in those things will drive you to search more about it and make you feel that you wanna know more and more about anything you are learning. I think it is a good idea if you identify the carrer that you want to take and start getting into it at a young age, because you will have more time to know and study about it and how it works, and it is gonna be more easy",0
"There is many motives to don't be idle, but I consider that the most significant could be your own health. My grandfather is 80 year old and he worked all his life, all my family members says that he is so intelligent, and can see the satisfaction in his eyes when he accomplish something,

I used to be idle when I'm in a difficult situation in my life, that don't make me feel good enough at all, is quite the opposite, that make me feel in a situation or stress or anxiety. I'm strongly agree with Thomas Jefferson statement about...""determine never to be idle... Even my doctor says that I need to distract myself practicing some sport or at least walk around the street. Doing something productive keep your body and mind working, and as we know exercise help us to avoid many kinds of diseases, and perhaps raising our lifetime. that something simple but changed my life, because I met people, I made new friends and I've got a job where I feel so confident. It's like my grandfather told me someday in the past...""

if I stop to work, I'll die,because, work help me to forget all my bad situations in my life even my diseases, and instead of that I always thinking... but that wasn't easy, because I fought and I'm still fighting against my pride and my arrogance that don't let share good times with the people around me.

You can learn more if you are always doing something, even if you make mistakes, because of mistakes you will know how to avoid them in the future,at the same time that would help you to develop new skills which is a good benefit for yourself when your looking for a good job or social position.

You going to be able to make more task easily, making you more intelligent. what would be my next task to accomplish

?"". it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". , because you are earning experience, the experience also you will help you, to know what you really want to do in the future.

"As a Mather of fact , look at all the Hollywood stars' , some of them didn't born with success some of them were poor, having no skills ,and some of them didn't have no education. Thing he say they are true, they can open your mind, and make you think.

Yes : I agree with Winston Churchill.    . When somebody want to be success in he/she fail, that doesn't mean they cannot "" try"" again. They work hard in hard to be success cause that was their gold to be "" success"" in they accomplish it even if they fail sometime.

Winston Churchill was right about that, i'm 100% agree with his statement. Failure without trying "" does not"" gave nothing excepted discourage, in that will be stupid of you if you failure in you give up in the same time.

3) Failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm will give you something in return, in that is ""fact"" no dispute about it. But the thing is, they need to get up in keep trying on till then.

If success brought people failure to failure, then what would that be in life, when you fail on try to be success, it not a bad thing cause sometime in life either you: win or you loos, but at least you can try one more time. For example : Generic_Name his a psychology teacher in Generic_School,Generic_Name never thought he will be a teacher cause his gold was to teach psychology, unfortunately he cant past his test so that he can graduated, but he thought about it , he put all his enthusiasm on it Generic_Name past the test in now his a successful guy. That's a true statement for success, in

I really Agree with Churchill's statement about the important role failure plays in the pursuit of success.

If you have a gold to be success in you though you a failure , don't like that why cause with : enthusiasm, and consists you can accomplish anything, even thing that you image you'll never accomplish or be success. Winston Churchill is a good person everybody knows that, a person that give good idea or a person that bring idea to life . If you a failure in then you loss your enthusiasm you will never be "" success"" . Even those who loves you can make fun of you, it they sees you keeping failure; or stay away from you on till you ""win"" or find what you want's.

Anabel for you to be success you need enthusiasm, it gonna give courage, and not to focusing on you failure, then you'll never success or accomplish your gold. I know some people say that too, to be success at first; you going failure to failure, in once you try not to failure guest what, you fail again. Winston idea was right, so my position is that success consists of going from failure to failure without loosing enthusiasm are lesson you. This can be happen , but Winston was right , to success you can fail all the time. Failure might be discourages you, but you can Always keeping going to accomplish your gold, or maybe you might "" successful"" after all.

1)Success is a good thing for those who fail in fail in the results, they successful. An in endurance can bring you to successful too, in time you'd need it.

2)If you pursuit or enthusiasm your can success anything that you thing that hard can be easier's for you, cause you put your ; Enthusiasm, and convicted your issue. Thats it true enthusiasm try to find your success can make a big differences. There are tree reason that "" success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.

ONE, if you a failure in you didn't put your enthusiasm on you ""success"" you'll never be successful.

TWO, take example about people who never thought they will success, such ass Generic_Name, Generic_Name,and Generic_Name Generic_Name.

TREE, always get up when fail, always focuses on you success, and take that serious when you a failure. With enthusiasm your success going greats and fast",0

I like to be my own personality because i know what i am doing and i am doing because i like it and when people told to stuff or me trying to be a different person just because they dont how i am or that way i dress or look. Because when i work in group who talk a lot i cannot focus on my work or they are just talking stupid stuff and trying to be funny there is when i get mad or when they trying to put me in there conversion that i do not care because if i am not talking to you or to the group that mean i am good and i do not need you or i dont need your opinion. Also if you think we are friends and you start to get conferees around me and you start talking about your life i am just going to walk away because i didnt ask you about your life because i am not interesting in your life because if i did i probably would ask you but if i didnt ask that mean i really dont care what do you do or what do you like. Been around people is not my type stuff i like to do i just rather to be alone and do my own stuff but if need help would ask someone who i think they know just go to the internet and try to found what i need online. I like to work alone with no body bother me . or sometime i like to work when the place is quiet because i can focus more and the place is quiet i can do my work in peaces. When am working like to listen to music because it let me to focus what am doing and i dont get distracted with the others student talking about drama or what is going on an there life or school. If i dont like you you better understand i wont be nice to you and i wont try to have a conversation with you. Or event class class if i am not talking with anyone the mean i dont want yall to talk to me or if i dont like the teacher i just keep my distance but if the teacher i dont like and she/he come at know where an start yelling at me i wont stay quiet and i will say stuff back to you because you just come to my face an start yelling at me for no reason so that is telling me that you got a problems with me and i didnt know at about it. If you leave me alone we probably we be cool and we wont have any issues with each other. so just because i couldn open the exhibit window am going to write about what do you i like to do in class. Because i dont like to bother people just to do it or try my best to guess in the answer.. sometime i like to with work with groups but is all depend what type of people am working with and also how is my mood during the day of in the class. And i cannot be a other type of person who i am not because i will be lying to myself and lying to the people around me just because i am acting different or look different for other people to think i am like that. when the work in a group i like to work with people that wont talk to much and we do our own work. Also when am in class i dont like when teachers or student start asking me question where i am from or what do i like to do. Also i like to have my personal bubble because i dont like when teacher or student come to my face and start asking me about stuff that i do not know or when they give me a attitude so that is the time when the situation will star to get worse because every time when the happen i will do the same to do them but mine it will be worse and sometime i cannot control myself. It is so ease if you respect me i will respect you back because if you come at mo where an start saying stuff to me and i really dont know what is going on i swear will disrespect you and say a lot stuff to you because you came to me saying stuff and every time that happen i really dont care if i hurt you or i hurt your feeling,0
"For me being a high school students all the elective classes I do helps me with the course I'm taking in college and doin online classes was the best way to get it done.

Programs you make in school and trying to be in it will help you with all the work you have. Graduating three years instead of four years you can get everything done. Some school offer programs for students to help them with there grading and work they make during the past school year. Doing everything done with work at school can get ready for everything to be done.

Do students do online classes and night school right now? If so, how do students get it done with all the activity and what programs they do to make it done. Early gradutes, yes, there's alot of them in the country to just get there education done with everything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                . This oppoturniy graduating early helps me get ready for school.

Classes in school is hard because they helping you out to get ready for college, because when you enter college its very different than in high school because all the oppotunity you can make for your self. My prompt say that district school offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. Colleges do look at your scores and work you do with all the information you do in school all the records and everything. Do students do online classes and night school right now? Tutoring and and night classes and can help with everything you need in college.

Students that graduate early helps you to get ready for college. Some students wanna do online class and night school to help them graduate and get there GPA for there classes for college. The classes you do to understand all the things that happen in each course to help out all. Being orgizinize with all the work you do in school can help you with all the work you will do in college this is you being independent for everything you do in high school because teacher's helping you out. The more work you get done during summer it counts your GPA scores. This helps all the opportunity for them to understand the learning. Having good grades and always in school that's one of the records to make college look at you and be like I want her to know to be in my college.

I will say that offer programs from different school you can get accept with all this around you because this can help you out with all the career you do in high school. I remember all the year that I did all my best for high school I've done after school tutoring and morning tutoring to just get everything done so I can just graduate and help my family. That's why students graduate early. For example, I know a lot of people that that do classes in the morning and at night time to catch all the work for the classes they hard",0

Using social midia at school can cause a bad point of view of the school,examples of it can be recording fights, or sexual things. MEMORANDUM

I See no problem not a big essue about using cell phones at school,a lot of students need the cell phones to stay informed or to keep in contact with the parents,students can use cell phone in case of an emergency at school. Cell phones are a safe thing for the students at this times. Some students don't have a way to search a subject or a problem because they don't have a computer with,so the cell phone is faster, and small easy to look through,share ideas with other students,point of view about a subject,political opinions,stay informed what is going on outside of school,students have to be informe about everything that happens outside of school,bloquing students devices can cause a bad effect and this will make then find other way to brake the rules again,and get what they want .I think students should be allowed to use cell phones for this reasons.

However, some students can take to other side,and don't pay atenttion in class because of the cell phones,a big part use cell phones to play games,or get distracted with music,and this can affect a lot of other students in the class,use to much of the cell phones also affect the social midia",0
"Also people would most likely notice and ask why you change yourself and that would bring back memories and make you go back in time and see why you change yourself. I don't agree with the fact that people have the courage to change for others, because in any case they should just be thereselfs and love them for who they are, is the greatest accomplishment and feeling ever.

It is the greatest accomplishment because of the feeling that you loved yourself and secceeded without someone bringing you down and making you change yourself is the best feeling to feel. Do you think the greatest accomplishment in the world is to be yourself in a world that is trying to change the person you are?, because I do not think people should change themself ever for what god brought us in the world for who we are and not changing ourself for others. Otherwise the people who are trying to bring you down are winning and you are giving them the power that they should not have. But if you dont change yourslef no one would know and wont bring up any badly past back memories. People will go through tough times but it does not mean you should automatically change yourself for that. So yes, I agree with Emerson statement about individuality, because people in this world are trying to change themselfs for others or just changing themselfs because they dont like themselfs for who they are. So then you have the power and accomplished the negetivity that people are trying to change yourself.

Also being yourself does not mean you wont have mistakes because everyone does and that is okay just without you changging yourself and accomplishing thing is the best part of life. Everyone goes threw a situation that they probebly think they hate themself and wanna change the person they are, but I think that is wrong and they should be thereselfs and understand that everything will be alright at the end without them trying to change themselfs.

In my opinion I do not think that changing yourself will help with anything and I think it would probebly make things worst. So in all saying that everyone should not change and be themselfs in a world that is constantly trying to change them. In today's generation with all the social media we have people that have been rude and comment someting bad to make you feel bad about yourself and then some people change themself just because of a comment that could hurt someone. People would most likely be so positive if they would be themself and not changing constantly or ever themselfs for people who are ignorent. Also mistakes can happend and if you change yourself and go back and see old pictuers of you of how you used to be you might not like for who you are now and you cant go back because you change yourself for someone you did not want to be I mean you could always try but why try after you did it and cant go back.

So just be you and do not change for others who are constantly trying to make you something else who it is'nt you. . It is such an amazing feeling and more people in this world would be great if they would'nt change for someone else because they would get the confidence and not worrying about what others has to say about them. People who love you would never say to change the person you are because that is just wrong and they know that they would not want to lose you as the person you are. There are so many reasons why I agree with this statement especially in today's society that most people in this world are changging themselfs for someone else. But if you can secceed people will leave you alone, because they know you will not listen to the rude comments you would recive and there just wasting there time. It is okay to have mistakes because everyone learns from them and next thing they will do better then the last time they did something bad or had a mistake. LIke for an example if you change yourself nothing is gonna happend just you letting yourself down and changing who you are that should not have been in that situation",0
"The quote, '' hard work pays,'' means a lot when it comes to doing something and one staying idle. For instance, since Bill Gates is hardworking man, he is known across the globe and due to this he has been exposed to other new things that would help him in whatever he is doing now. People choose idleness because it is more relaxing and the easiest way to go because you just sit there and wait for whatever happens to happen. No one gets rich by just sitting at home, folding his hands and just expect something to happen. People who invest in their time to produce something meaningful are known across the globe because of their hard work and dedication. The world today upgrades itself each and everyday,which tells us that we should always be doing new everyday as humans.

Although some people say that been idle is the best way to go because it relaxes the body and gives it a new form of strength actually doing something always not only exposes one to new ideas and strategies but also makes the human body active and vibrant at all times. Productivity brings a lot of good things in a person's life than any other thing a person can think of while Idleness brings nothing but retrogression in one's life.. Although some people say that been idle is the best way to go because it relaxes the body and gives it a new form of strength actually doing something always not only exposes one to new ideas and strategies but also makes the human body active and vibrant at all times.

It always good to look at the brighter side of good and it is always advisable to go for what is right. On the other hand, idleness brings nothing but retrogression and failure because you're not able to bring forth anything productive and therefore it becomes a waste of time,energy and resources. One can make the comparison so easily between a productive person and someone been idle, a productive person can always be seen advancing from one stage to the other while an idle person will be seen at the space that he is at always.

Furthermore, when people say '' time is money,'' they are definitely talking about how one is able to use his available to produce something meaningful for himself to get money and have some other benefits as well. This may be true because you may have everything to yourself but everything will be squandered if one does not work hard to top it up or add more to what he has. For instance when a person walks about a half and a mile to work everyday, it is very difficult to see that individual get sick because the body is always busy looking for something to do. Due to how hardworking they are, they get the chance to explore new ways of doing things and new ideas that would help them in their next exploitation. Due to this someone else can decide to emulate his footsteps to become a world star like him.

Again no one chooses to be last in whatever he is doing but rather aims at the high spot. A person who is seen to be doing something productive all the time is considered to be adding more years to his or her age due to the fact that working tirelessly everyday helps keep the body in form and shape which by so doing prevents diseases that attack people. For instance, Usain Bolt has been winning almost all his race in the Olympics and it sends a good message about him to the world because of how hardworking he is. In the sense that, if a person is seen to be at one place all the time, it may be considered that the person may be lazy and this may deprive him off certain opportunities that might help him in one way or the other.

Last but not least, working hard or been productive gets one a recognition or a specific type of award that goes a long way in life. People may argue on this that one can make it in life when he or she inherits the possession from his family. There are a lot of chances one can benefit from been productive other than been idle.

To start with, there are a lot of goodness in been productive than been an idle man. Again, when there is a football match between two different teams, and if one team is seen practicing so hard than the other, it would be considered that the team seen practicing the most would deliver more than the other team with no doubt.

Moreover, doing something always makes an individual active and lives longer than been idle. Been idle can also affect a person in way or the other. There is no doubt about the fact that people who work hard are awarded the most and are the ones that are shown to the world for others to see and emulate their footsteps",0
"If it was just a city with no voice in the community then the city would fall into a bad place which no one wants to be in and the key advice is to receive it.

In the world we live in, we make a lot of important choices in life, some are big and some are small, but they effect our future and success. Next, advice from others can make you more wiser when you make your own choices, if

Abraham

Lincoln never saw how African Americans were treated for there skin color he would have never signed the documents for slavery to be band. You will have a mindset that will help you be more successful and a hard worker. Only instead its intellects make the right choice to help you.

In Conclusion, advice is there to help you, opinions are there to guide you to something that gives you smarts to making the right choices in the world we live in live, sure not all opinions hear might not be in your favor. At some point in our lives I know we got advice from someone we look up too,also what ever the advice they gave you, is an add on to bigger things, for example if a parent or guardian gives you some advice to never quit on things or problems that are hard and difficult for you, with just that you will Carey that for the rest of your life. if he never got advice he mostly likely would have never Andres the problems with having that toxic racism. Have you ever wounder why that is the case?, if you are a person who does not take advice from another individual , then you could use this skill, taking advice from another person can help you make better life choices, it will make you understand things more clearly and faster, and learn from them. Multiple opinions is like trying different types of food from different chefs and if you just try it, you will see something you might like, if you never try something you will never see a different possibility taking advice is just like that. If it wasnt for him, it would still be here today thanks to out 16th President, which boils down to good thinking and advice. . Which eventually make you more wiser and resistant to challenges and in life. When people ask for advice

, they sometimes talk to more than one person. When you are at that point you will know what is right and wrong, from advice from your remodel, father, and mother. Multiple opinions really is a foundation to a job like a mayor of a city, it is vital to take advice from the community in order to address problems and concerns. But just hear them out and be the best you that you want to be shaped in, advice will make yo wiser and more aware of scenarios",0
"Getting your business done without any praising and knowing you put your all into it could make you feel way better about yourself and it would just not motivate you but the people around you. Teachers should let students achieve their goals and not worry about what the other person has to do or say. However, if a student works really hard to achieve something,then that feeling of completion can motivate them to continue to their path of success. I say this because people don't usually thank you or give you any comments they usually mean. So what if they dislike your achievements? so what if they start doubting? prove them wrong with all your accomplishments that are coming your way. Students will also have a harder time dealing with constructive criticism. If you achieve something and you keep on achieving things in life you will get many blessings. You would never know what could come out someone's mouth.

They wouldn't want to agree with this but, that's because we all think different and most of us know the real meaning behind something similar to this. By accomplishing something could make you learn new things in life too. Make them regret what they said and go accomplish more.. People get confused and don't get the message, we need more people to believe in their selves and not about what other people have to say.

Although I think it's nice of people complimenting and saying positive things about your work but, I still have to go with achieving it on your own. People don't usually know the difference between praising and achieving your goal without it. By overpraising a student his or her confidence has to be on a different level. You don't need people telling you about your work or whatever you are doing because at the end of the day you're the only one who knows what you're accomplishing in life. I agree that praising a students work is an outstanding idea to jump start a students path to success,but praise is not the way to increase their self-esteem",0
"Building self-confidence may be hard on some students because the way they was raise or the way they are treated by others; Students should be able to build up self-esteem for their own good reasons in life, learning may be hard on some students at first but is just one of the task they have to get through putting a lot of effort in to it wot be that hard getting it done will be; Others may believe that praise given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. Does true Self-esteem come from praise or does it come from achievements? Self-esteem comes from achievements; Achievements that you got to make the risk for put up in life throughout school. Self-confidence is really important for people to feel good about their own selves. Students should be able to do work that they understand good enough at their own risk to make the effort of being self-confident. Some people may not agree just because building up self-confidence is not an easy thing to do or even an easy thing to accomplish in life. There i'll be some difficult times where you will want to give up in life times where you will feel like you just can't do it anymore, but students struggle with their own personal problems but they can get through it all and that is what makes the build-up self-confidence about the risk and task they make in life.",0
"Doing online school would maybe not have time to socialize with new people. Having different environment could help you to learn more and plus you would not be by your self. The laziness of student could end up with no good grades or passing the class, would take the class all over. Would have to figure it out by your self. Life could be hard sometimes and you could go through things that you don't expect to happen. You could have study patterns and you could ask them for help. Doing online school its just you and the computer and the class you are taking. Doing your work is one important thing to do, to understand the class and what its teaching. Students always choose whats right for them. Not doing the work that they assigned you.

When a student have class online they could find it defalcate to achieve the work that they been assigned to. If you where in a class room you could ask a teacher to show you how to solve it and you would probably would understand it more. It would be helpful for student to attend more class and probably have more free time. Some school don't provide this type of programs, in others do. Not having a different environment with people with the same age. In the same day you have to turn it in. Your WIFI could go slow or not work at all. It could have a negative part to attending online school. Sometimes student don't have the time and sometimes they don't turn in there work on time. Attending classes online could be defalcate to achieve. Not just going online to find something that kind of looks like the work and you just copy it down. Would just put it to the side and say"" they would probably do it later"" and never do it. Attending classes online dose not always work out for students. People would agree that is a good idea but other would say its bad idea. In online school sometimes there is no teacher available at the time when you need them. Having classes online you would not be sou round with people your age.

Doing online class sometimes could give out a lot of work to do in one day. Different school have different ways of doing things. You could do what pace you want and to do your classes. Different type of people have different type of view of attending classes online. It could be online class or going to a classroom in a school. The program that the school provides for attending classes online could have a positive outcome or it could have a negative outcome. You would not be able to ask question about the problem. Would probably leave it for the last minute to turn it in. Having online class you don't have to wait for other people to finish. Not just you home by yourself with a computer. Some online website would not help you to achieve what you are looking for. It could give a bad answer and then you got the whole assignment wrong. Not doing the work, it would not take you no where and would not finish the class on time before the due date.

The school would give different ways for student to attend class. Sometimes student could take advantage on this program to just stay home and do nothing. Would not be sou rand by people their age and probably not do there work. It could be defalcate when you don't know the subject and there is no teacher around to help you. Have other people with you in the same room. Sometimes student could get lazy and not do there work. You may work or do other things but most of the times they could be older or you just don't talk to people a lot. Having a hard time to achieve the work. Probably have friends but they mite not be taking the same class as you,would not be a able to work together or study. You could get distracted really fast with other things that is going on in your life. It could be found defalcate to achieve the work on time.

When you so round your self with people that are the same age. In videos you could find ways to achieve it but sometimes there is not a lot of videos on things that you are looking for.    . It could be challenge when you dont know what they are talking about or you just don't understand it",0
"However the problem is that some people are avaricious, think that are better that others people and want all at the same time.

The first reason is that some people are avaricious, is a bad influence for the people that want grown in the jobs, school and in the milieu family, for example my brother not finish the school, Because He like the money and He think the best solution will be leak of the school for work more and have more money. And now He say that is not good idea leave the school for money.

So they's think that are better that other people, for the society cause indifference to the other people, rejection would be also bulling. For that you can grow and can be a good person, and be intelligent because the vanity is bad adviser.. The author who wrote this line was very smart based in the life actuality the people when say, "" you will never grow"" I'm agree with the author I think in this world some people not are conform with the that have. I am disagree with the thought of this type of people for example, if she/he can make something grand also the other people can the major greatness is the humility.

The third reason is want all at the same time, when the author talk about ""you will never grow."" Is because the knowledge of the life is not obtain things materials amount, because in this life all is vanity if you want grow start for conform with the little that you have for example, the education help for that you will be a good person with principles.

The conclusion is that the life have many opportunities bad you have the option take one opportunity",0
"When working alone there is none of this to worry about because it is a independent assignment.

When working in a group not everyone is going to agree with each other on the same ideas. Agreeing on something would take up to one or two classes and that would waste a lot of time and put the project behind. When being put with someone who does not care is hard because only the rest of the group is doing the work and putting in effort. When working alone there is not agreeing on anything, it is whatever that person chooses.

Working in a group it would be more fun but when working alone more work can be done. When working alone the worry of a group member not coming to school is not a thing because its alone.

When someone in the group does not care about the work the group will be held back because then more work would have to be done by the others. Some people also argue that working alone has more benefits then working in a group. In a group there is more communication, sometimes that communication can hold someone back a negatively impact their grade. If one person says they do not like that idea, the group would have to take time and all agree on something as a group. if a person in the group is sick with a virus they would have to miss school and miss work on the project and that would hold back the rest of the group from turning in the project on time. Working alone is more beneficial the working in a group because, if one person in the group does not come to school the group will be short a person, if a member in the group does not care about the project, and not everyone is going to agree with each others ideas and opinions.

If a member in the group does not come to school the group will fall behind and not turn the work on time. Working in a group would also not be fun because you have someone who is not doing anything. Some people argue that working in a group has more benefits then working working alone. When the group is working the one who does not care would be sleeping or on their phone. Being pared with friends is nice but the amount of work able to get done when alone is a lot more.    . When being put with someone who does not come to school often will cause stress on the rest of the group and also a delay",0
"So, I recomment should follow this model by extending the school day two hours. So parents worry about the foreground for them children.

In my opinion I think school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours because this pattern is very good for economize resources. Because students need learn five-day knowledge in four-day. We mast economize them. The resources is very limited in our world. . them children may do not study. We can do a easy math for this question. This way may economize resources so school can use this pattern also.

But for this idea people have different opinion. Someone say school should not follow this model by extending the school day two hours because only four-day school students can not learned enough knowledge. It may promote students efficient study. And three-day weekend is too long. Some businesses have four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. How to economize resources? It become a topic. The efficient study is useful for the study and work at future.

The resources is valuable for us. But in my opinion I think school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours because this pattern is very good for economize resources and four-day school may promote students efficient study.

Some parents think four-day school is too sort for them children can not learned enough knowledge. That is why I am agreed the four-day school.

The four-day school have benefit to student also. How many electric for one lamp? How many lamp in one school? How many school in US? You can image it is a big resources spend just for electric",0
"so many people they do not bealive them self , well we born poor people , so nothing is imposible ,trying what we want to do in the life . Generic_Name

what you have already mastered ,those people they don't bealive they don't grow up ,that is not true we have to create a new things improve us self we don't like to stay the same place and nothing is imposible.

I'm agree with Emerson's statement what I already know that's a adventage for us . because it is easy doing something what we have already know ,but if we never try it , and we never know if we can do it, I need improve my self and switch my position that's a new goal . with the time we can get , and reach what we always dreaming.

You will never grow up , if you doing the same things in the life there is I lot opportunity in the world choose a new goal you will see so many change on your way don't give up.

It's easy doing what I already know because we feel comfortable doing ,for example on my work , I'm working busboy helping the server we working team work ,and easy but the problem is want to be a server but they never let me to try it i want to grow up swith a position to earn more money.

Creater a new things , we have so many skill to grow up don't be afraid doing or tying new things we want to improve us self I don't like to stay the same place doing the same things I don't see any improve on my life your life can be change a week but you have to be a positive ,don't give up , try it, isn't nothing bad.",0
"Teenagers would be more responsible for themselves. It should be law for them to come home to there parents early and not be roaming around in the streets.

Adopting a 10 P.M weekday and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers would risk less trouble and deaths for them. Also, play video games with there friends online. They would have less risk to be out in the streets late night. Cops have to be involed and check the streets for teenagers roaming around after there curfew. They would enjoy more time with there familys. If would benefit them for a job that they would have to get early too. Eventhough it interferes with there young life.

Teenagers would get used to being home early. Teenagers wouldnt miss out of dinner made by there family.

Teenagers would stay out of trouble. They could be stopped from doing bad late night and coming home. The teenagers parents would see them come home everyay and not have to worry about them. The city council should adopt a 10 P.M wwekday and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. If there are teenagers out in the street after there curfew, they should in trouble. Also, parents would stress less if they theyre child came home early.     . Finally, they would have time to spend with there faamily and see them again. Students would really benfit them for getting home early. Also, they would have time to do there homework or work they have to do. Teenagers would out of trouble from the police only if they dont pass there curfew.

For teenagers to actually go home before there curfew",0
"Shows them that you did it all by yourself.. When i was in 1 grade in my country Honduras one teacher tell my mom that i'm not in math the i'm going to fail the grade and i did it. I know i'm going to be a lawyer because if you not fight back for your dreams. Not allowed other people said you never going to make never.

If you fail one time or more doesn't mean you never going to make is the contrary. One time in my school we have to said what we want to be when we grow up and i said i want to be a lawyer. When i was a kid my dream was the i want to be a lawyer. In my whole life that it is 18 years old i fail many time but i always i had in mind. You are gonna make don't allowed other person said what exactly you had to do.

In the future i hope people never give up in their dreams just because they fail one time or more and also show the person's who tell you ""You never gonna make it"". I'm happy that i fail 1 grade because shows me if you fail one time doesn't mean you had to give up , you had to figth back like i did.

I always said to me you had to fight back never give up in my dreams no matter how difficult is. But my mom tell me that and she also tell me if you fail the grade it's no becasue you are not intelligent. I fail i learn a new lesson today beacuse all the fail times i had in my life i take as a lesson to help to prepare for the real world and how it is.

Someone may think i wrong to think like that but they are the wrong ones beacuse no ones is perfect in life everyone make a mistake or fail in something in life

To be a successful person in life you have to take step by step and also no matter how many time you fail keep going. That's mean your i said you are failure person and i'm not a failure person. Do you think a good way to success in life you had to fail first?.

In this paper i will argue about, why people should believe fain in life it is so important because if you fail a least in one thing in life it's help you be more confident and be prepared for the real world and also help you that if you want something you had to fight for the.

My mom always tell me "" Be confident i believe in you"". It's because it is difficult for you but i know you can do it and i did it the next year i have to take again 1 grade but that year was diffrent and the teacher tell's my mom that it was amazing how good i was in math and the other class too. One student tell me how could you be a lawyer you never going to complete that career and said to him you never know no matter how many times i fail",0
"because if you led the world to choose for you you will never going to get satisfy. because when you do something that you like to do you will never going to get tire about doing it, when you like to do something and you wanted to be the greatest accomplishment, you are not going to feel that job like a job because is something that you like to do. To make that happen you should have to make your own decisions, because if you let the world to choose for you in the future you may get lost and tire about your life, because you let the world to take control over your life, and for not choosing your own decision. Always be your self because if you led the world to choose for you will have a bad and sad feature for for not choosing the right decision. sometime you let the world to choose for you, but in the future you will get bored because you did not choose what you like. Lots of people let the world to choose for them and in future they ruin their life and they don't know whats to do for not choosing the correct choice and because they let the world to choose for them.

In conclusion, never led the world to change your life . Being your self and not letting the world to try to make something else, is something that will bring goods in your future, because is something that you choose and you know why did you took it and why did you choose it. Author Ralph Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" He is totally wrong because to be yourself in a world and make the greatest accomplishment in your life, the wold do not have to take control over you liberty, you should take control over the world to accomplish whats you are going to be. . But to make that happen and accomplish that dream. If you want to do the greatest accomplishment in your life you should take something that you that you like to do. So you should not let the world to ruin their life, and take their own decisions and tell the world that you can do it in your own. never led the world to do what ever it wants with you.

Being your self and not letting the world to take control over your life, the best choice that you can do, because being yourself and choose your own decision will help you to know what to do,what's good , what's bad, what career to choose, and what goal to accomplish because the only person who know all about you is you. However, the peoples that let the wold to choose for them they will get tire about life.

The second thing for accomplishment; and not letting the world to control you,is being your self and do what you like to do, never letting the world to do whatever it wants to do with you. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson did not think before writing these letter because to be yourself in a world, you should have to make your own decisions, do something that you would like to do, and being your self not letting the world to take control over your life.

First thing,

be yourself and never give the right to the world. If you want to make real the greatest accomplishment, never led the world to change you. Always do a things what you like to do, like sports or a profession that you would like to be, if you choose things that you like you never going to feel it like a job",0
"Yes teenagers should do curfews because they will stay out of trouble and stop braking the law. They will be discipline,and have respect of themselves and others example lets say you have a child is a minor and he or she breaks the laws and always gets in to trouble the military is one of things that will keep you discipline or otherwise they won't be well trained. However, they will carry the behavior through their work place and public areas with good attitude and good behavior and it will never interfere of young person's live for example,lets say a job interview and the person who wants to hire you and he or she will see your characteristics and how many times you have broke the law and getting into trouble the person won't hire you can't get a job when you have a bad record of committing crimes and facing the law so, curfews are a good suggesting with young people that you can't say no to. The next thing I want to add is young people have to be shown and have experiences the a 10:pm weekend curfew is a descent amount of time to get them well trained other places like military, Juvenile, and like closing of businesses. Teenagers have a hard time staying in one place of a very long time with no free time a midnight curfew for teenagers is good for them so they can reflect and learn for their mistakes.

Some teenagers are committing crimes and getting away with it but this program well benefit them but in a matter time they will become good teenagers and obey the law. However, another example is vandalizing when you harm someone's property without permission as an example like graffiti, braking car window's, and invading somebody else's property.

In conclusion, every teenager who brakes laws should attend to curfews for a beneficial life experiences so they can get the best out of them and they can prevent teenagers out of trouble.",0
"I think police one is correct because not only the students sometimes need to call their parents to come to pick then up or pick up early or come bring their lunch, but also because is impossible to make everyone obey Policy number 2, even if is a school policy most people will ignore it, so I think Policy number 1 is harder to be ignored. Dear Principal

The Police i think is correct is Policy 1. So I think that sometimes phones are useful at school.

If we put policy number 2 at school it wouldn't make any bad things but students would still not following it, and lots of students would have their phone taken away or get in trouble because of their phones uses at school during lunch time or free time. I think sometimes phones are problem while using during class, but if is in lunch or free time I don't see much problem, because you are not being rude, or interrupting anyone. And even if we have a Policy against cell phones students would ignore it if is at lunch time because nobody is there to tell them not to use it, and the school already have to much to pay so the school would not pay someone to look at those students who are using cell phones during lunch. So I think that school are a problem while using it in class but I think that is not bad to use it during lunch time or free time.",0
"There are some specific reasons about the importance of attitude and why we should consider this or not a fact to success in life.

The importance of attitude is a fact to success in life. It teach us the easies way to live successfully in life. In my opinion, i agree with the statement that a possitive attitude is the key of success. But, sometimes we don't consider the important things that can make us success in life. For example, if we have a possitive attitude we will avoid dangerous sickness.

Easies way to live. For example, being relaxed is a result of having a possitive attitude.

In conclusion, a possitive attitude is the key of success. For example, in a job to get better opportunities we need a possitive attitude to develop our skills.

To live a healthy life. Attitude can be one of those facts that can make us success. Can a possitive attitude be the key to success in life or should we live the way we believe is better?

Daily we live the way we want to.                            . As we know, we need a possitive attitude to get some things in life",0
"They can also get help someone make a better choice. You might learn different opnions from alot of different people and they can give you alot of advice on what not to do and what you should do. The more people ask for advice they will get multiple opinions. So thast why I think people should ask for others peoples advice all the time. I think it is a good idea that people should ask for others peoples advice because they can learn extra info from them. Its smart because if people ask for other peoples opinions they will get more ideas and facts and what they should do next.

The second reasons why I think people should ask multiple questions to a variet of different people is because so they can get alot of responses and more answers to their questions.                                                                                                                                                                                              . Because if you tell multiple people for an advice they can get more opinions from people. If I dont ask questions iill never get any responses or advices",0
"The misnister of

Wilnston churchill, he say that success in life or anyother things, theres a failure and don't lose enthusiasm because of that litlle things or because you fail one time in your try.

I agree with the minister churchill say because succsee it's a way to improve your skills or be betther in what you did and you try to not haves more make mistakes annymore, success can have failure but also you can lern for them, and learn how to rersolve your pronlemsand see how far you can go by trying, how you can have more expiriense by traying and traying again and again, no making mistakes annymore so the next time you don't have the same mistakes or pronblems because you larn about it.

I think with success you can learn a lot of experiance in your life, because with your failure you learn about it, because if you leave it like that you not trying and you are not exploing your self, so if you exploit your self you can see how far you can go to resolve the problems or the mistake you have.

So if you explod your self trying more and more you can maybe resolve the problem or see how far you can go to find a solution, the thing is if you keep trying your best in somthing you don't know exacly what it is or how to resolve it in many times you can find a solution and fix it.

failure is not you are not going to resolve it because if you are doing your best but you keep failure is becuase you need to find the problem you are not seeing, to resolve it failuture is not because is not working success is because you didn't find the solution at your problem.

For my conclusion for success you have to pass for a lot of problems and mistakes so you can find a solution for it, in your life if you don't explow your self you won't know what was the problem to that but if you explow your self you can find the solution and also learn from that, trying hard and hard moust of the times you can find a solution for evryting and that is how you also you can help others with they problems like when they say two heads is better then one.",0
"I have a beautiful life, and my life always is with laugh, laugh, I am creazy, and I love to be creazy, my personality is unique. I learning to be my self, so ""Yes"" I make a greatest accomplishment in my life, and is nice to be your self, now i feel relax, and satify with my decisions, I desmostrated what I am. Ralph Waldo Emerson, cause i feel identified with what he say; I feel a winner, i feel happy with my personality, and is because i don't care what the people say, or think about me, is my life, I take my decisions. The little girl who always was doing what the people saying is in the past not in my present. So we need to be what we want to be, and love yourself is the most important thing, if you not love yurself no one can love you more then you, obviously we have to know what decisions we want to take, you have to feel good with yourself, with your decisions. So we never will be fine.

Everybody can judge, but we have to be strong, we have to try to demostrate what we are, or what we like to do.

Razons:

We can have a lot of bad situations in this life, Maybe one day we can feel bad or sad, Because we not feel good with the people who judge, maybe we are tired to feign to be another person, or maybe we can think in a negative way. You have to show what you are, if you feel good you will be good.

All this are razons for which one is hard to be yourself, and is for that razon i agree with Mr. A example of this could be say ""I never do something good"", "" I am not a good person"". I agree with this statement, because is hard to be yourself, in a world like this, where the people judge everything in your life, and you have to be how they want, they always are telling you what you have to do or what you not, and they not care about your opinion.

A example:

In my personal life is with my family, they always are telling me what I have to do, and when I do something wrong they judge me, they want to select my friends, my clothes, include my shoes, in a situation like this is difficult to be what you really what to be, and the razon is because they don't give us a chance to demostrate what we really are.

Another example is:

With the people of outside, we never are going to be how they want, if they saw you with a boy who use tattoo they think he is a bad boy, if you are a fat girl your ugly, if you are skinny girl your ugly too, if you use a mini skirt you are a creazy women. I don't have to feign nothing. I like to be happy, be my self. and i like that, so I feel very happy.. I really love me. If I am a creazy women who always is imperative but i feel good with that am fine",0
"Strength, intelligente, problem solving skills, and experience are all thing that are gained from faiture and can lead to success.

Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that success consists of going from faiture to faiture without loss of enthusiasm. The success you end up having might not be the kind you originally had in mind. Then no one would learn from then. Failures could lead you into in something else entirely.

Failure often leads to problem, working to solve problems and getting through difficult times makes you smarter and stronger as a person. By dealing with your failures, you will be more prepared and experienced in the fututre. I think that failure plays a crucial role during the persuit of sucess.

Failure is inavoidable the path to success is not straight one.

everyone fails sometime in their life .

Walt disney was fired for a newspaper because he lacked creativity.

Learn from your mistakes, if you make a mistake at least you know not to do it again.

A failure might put an end to one thing (idea or opportunity) but lead you to other for example: I used to try to draw realistic people and animals with pensils, and then I found that i was better at zentangle (an art style that consists of repetitive designs and patterns. I think that faiture Plays a crucial role during the pursuit of success.

If there were not mistakes in life. Faiture is unavoidable, but it can be a useful tool that helps shape your future.

My conclusion is Faiture can change who you are and what path you're on in life, and I believe that it plays an important role in the persuit for success.

Mistake only makes us smarter and working to solve problems only makes us stronger.

Without faiture, no one would be sucessful.

"There could be two sisters being raised the same but one might have different habits or opinions than the other. People have their own dreams and choose their own path.

We choose our own paths. Not everyone thinks the same, and people are raised differently.

We were all raised differently. Yes, we are influenced by the people we see everyday and we might just take it as inspiration, but we are the ones who work towards our goals and not anyone else. For siblings, I think it is different because they are being raised by the same people and have almost the same points of view, but that does not mean they are or think the same. Not because I want to go to college and become a nurse, means that my best friend, that I spend most of the time with, would want to be a nurse or be in a medical field as me. The British naturalist and politician John Lubbock once wrote, ""Your character will be what yourself choose to make it

In my opinion, we do choose who we want to be. We do choose who we are because not everyone thinks the same, we choose our destiny, and parents raise their children with different habits and knowledge.. I once got invited to a party where I knew there were going to be lots of teens drinking and doing drugs, so I told my friend, who invited me, that I didnt wanted to go because I new it was bad. At the end of the day we choose who we want to be.

We choose who we want to be. I agree with John Lubbock because not everyone has the same intentions as the people who surround us, we choose our own path, and people are raised differently.

Not everyone has the same intentions as the people they hang out with. We choose who we want to become. For some people it is just fun and dont think about the consequences. Some people might think differently and say that we are influenced by the people we spend our time with",0
"Recently, Generic_School did a report that said three percent of people died in the year is because they feel alone, they think that no one with help them. Recently, my friend Generic_Name were in a problem of what sport should he choose and we all gave out different opinions because some of us think that which sport can benefit our future better, some of us think that is important to match your hobbies and benefit to your body health after you play the sport, but we never think about the sport that Generic_Name like better. It is important to think together with friends and family because it can help you with more ideas and power. After that, Generic_Name know it is very important to let parents know that his feeling.

Third, seeking for multiple opinions can let people feel like they are not alone to this problem, most of the time people can cause the mind to do wrong things because they feel like no one want to help them and leave them alone. Everybody will have a different idea because of their way to look at the problem, they might think the problem out of the box and give out some choice that you never think of. A wise man always said "" Thinking out of the box can get you a better choice."" Seeking multiple opinions can help people make a better choice for several reasons.

First, they will have more choices to choose due to this problem. It is important to think the problem in a different way because after that you can find a better way to solve it .

Second, seeking for multiple opinions can help you collect ideas and solve the problem with friends and family. If everyone can also help each other when they have a problem, maybe we can make the world much better.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can make people make a better choice and it can also benefit other and make the world much better .. Recently, my friend Generic_Name got bully in school two moths ago, Generic_Name cry in the restroom alone because the person that bully him told that

Generic_Name cannot tell anybody about what happen, after he get home he told his parents and principal start to find out the person bully Generic_Name",0
"My school mostly have all the resources, but we need to have more because more students are coming in from other countries. In most of my classes the lights are turned of, because we care about our school. In my school i mostly see all the lights are on, if there is no class the lights should be turned of, this is one of the big reason. So we should all try to save it. We should be taking care of our school, have it clean and dont waste. If we waste both of them we can't live with out it. Energy and resources, are one the most very important things in the world. It could change, if we have less school hours we could save energy. . Instead of that, we should be saving money on resources, so people can eat and save energy by turning most of the lights of just need to turn main lights on, beacuse in today's world companies make money of the people, by sending them extra bills eventhough they didn't use that much energy.

Schools are one the most places to waste more energy. This is why most the countries doesn't have one them or both, because they spent more money on, doing other stuff like makin new buildings, restaurants and etc",0
"Winston Churchill is using a statement that means that we dont have to give up easily we have to fight for something that we want to make real.

Example: The success in the school can be really difficult and more than one time we can fail because we dont do homework but we want to pass, so if we want to reach this goal we have to enthusiasm ourselves because we have a goal that we want to reach, so we are going to fix our failure and we are going to do everything because after school we want to go to college and get a good job.

In conclusion, the Churchill's statement has an important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. When Winston Churchill said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,"" he is only saying that sentence but it has a big meaning everybody can apply it in their lives, you can find the best outcomes just smiling to the problems. The enthusiasm help to the people to see the answer of the problems easily because the brain will be relaxed and will think the best things, however, when the brain is frustrated the brain can not think correctly. Sometimes we have to learn a lot from the failure and we dont see it, the failure can be some steps just to reach the success and the goods outcomes. The enthusiasm is a supply very important in the enroll for the success.. Sometimes the failure are really hard to resolve but if you really want to reach it you have to feel enthusiasm because I think that automatically you will see the answer clearly and easily and if you are frustrated your brain will not work and will be closed and sometimes when we are frustrated we are getting extras failure because we dont think clearly and we dont think about it. Success is the achievement of doing what you have tried to do or what to do. Winston Churchill is referring that no one have to loss the enthusiasm, however if you are making mistakes in your life and you are saying that you can not do it and you will try it but you are going to get the same results and you are giving excuse by excuse you will fail in your life because you are giving up easily and you dont see that every cost and fight at the end it has a benefit or something that you really wanted to get or a goal that you are trying to reach and you will see that you dont have to loss the hope and the enthusiasm in every dream that you want.

The failure has an important role in the pursuit of success, sometimes a lot of people do not have the enthusiasm and they think that it is the end of everything, the failure can be the destruction for a lot of people, but if you make a lot of mistakes and you are keeping fighting still to get your goals you will see how important is not give up easy and watch the positive part of your failures. I agree with the Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill because in my opinion, the failure makes to the people strong and the next time they can do it better. So, if you are enthusiasm you will do it very good because you want something that you want and also it will be something that will improve your life not just in the success of work or study it can be in all your whole life you can get success and everything if you apply this in your life, and the people around you like your family will see how important is this role in the life and they will want to learn about the enthusiasm in the failures and they will understand that sometimes we dont need to destroy ourselves or lost the head in something that we can resolve in an easy way that enthusiasm is helping us to improve ourselves.

I agree with Churchill's statement because the enthusiasm it is an important role you can motive to other people to be enthusiasm and they can resolve their problems using the same method. It does not mean that you will not care the problems, of course you have to resolve the problems and make them clear, because if you are making failures and people is affected and you dont care you just want to get your outcomes it will be a big problem, no body needs to be involved in your failures because the people around you will see that you are making a mistake and you are selfish.

Churchill's statement has big meanings and has good outcomes, everybody wants success but what happen when someone is trying to get success and miss? of course everyone will feel so sad and no one wants to try it again because the person is afraid of their failures, it is like if the failure is tying you and it does not want to leave you. An enthusiasm person has more possibilities to get success than a person sad, broken and a person who is thinking just negative thoughts or who is close that they will get the same result and give up easily like nothing will happen if he/she is going to try it.

The enthusiasm has an important role in the success because you will keep your head up and keep fighting for your goals all the time and every time that you will make a failure it will be more easy to resolve it, because you have a key and you are enrolling every time when you get one failure. Winston is showing us that the failure can be defeated it does not matter how long it is going to take but before the success you have to keep strong and smiling to the big failure. The failure is just a difficult step to reach the success and with enthusiasm we can defeat to the failures. The persons will be sad and their hopes will be down because they think that they are going the get the same outcome, but what happen if you raise your head with enthusiasm? Winston is trying to say us that the enthusiasm is very important to get the success because if you have enthusiasm you will fight with love for something that you really want. Sometimes we are making failures day per day, but if we become sad and we are closed that we can not do it again, we are losing something important in our life, but if we are doing it with enthusiasm we can improve our failures and do it better every time",0
"That's why I always prefer to work alone, so no body can interrupts what I think.

In conclusion, these years really changed my point of view because now I think that working alone is one of the best choices that a human can make because it makes a person over think and believe more in their self. I was in a group of four, I was trying to do my best by reading a book about earth and what causes earth get pollution, when one of my partners stopped me by removing the book that I had, that made me really angry, and now that makes me over thinking that working alone is one of the best choice that one person can make.

I remember the last year here at Generic_School, Generic_Name my health teacher told the class to make some groups for presentations about drugs and its diseases that these can cause. that's why I always believe that is better to work alone.

In my English class, the other day teacher made some groups, and each group had to make an essay about the contamination of earth. Work requires a lot of concentration. That day the teacher told us to make a surprise to the children with cancer. . Now I am ready to continue with this adventure. And also, each group have to pick their topic about what are you going to present she said. I had an idea to make a letter and a big poster with some illustrations to make those children happy, but we didn't because my partners didn't want to make the poster and we only did the letter. At Generic_School, I prefer to work alone because I do what I think, no body interrupt me and I concentrate better when I am by myself. I asked her if I could make the presentation by myself and she told me that I can, but it may be difficult for you because it is hard to explain in front all your partners she said. I remember one time when I was in middle school, I was working with a group of five students. I did my presentation about the alcohol, and she congratulated me because the hard work that I did.

She told me that she was glad about me because I did the best presentation from the class. I will give three reason and examples about why I think working alone is better than working with a group.

To follow at what my brain tells to me is the best decision I can ever do",0
"I believe that changing the school lunch menu would be a good idea, there are reasons why the change of the lunch would be good idea; It can help students who are sick, It can help the students who play in a sport team, it can help those student who abuse eating at home.

First reason: healthier school lunch menu can be good for many students who does fitness and also for those who play in the school sports teams, they need to be healthier, for example soccer players needs to be with good weight, so they can play good in their games, but if they are eating things with a lot grease they would not be on the team, because they are not eating healthy.

Second reason: The change of the school lunch menu can also be good for those students who abuse eating at home, for that I think the healthier lunch menu can be a good idea, because they abuse eating bad thing at home but, they eat healthier at school, that is the second reason why I choose that the healthy lunch menu is a good idea, because the students are eating better than what they eat at their homes.

Third reason: This last reason is to show that the healthy food is better, because it helps students who are with any type of disease whether is a terminal disease or a normal disease, it doesn't matter what kind of disease can be,

it just that eating healthy help them for example, there are many student who are with diabetes sometimes they to bring their lunch from their home, because at school there nothing they can eat, because everything may have grease or sugar on it, and that is the reason why student bring their lunch, because of their disease, so that is why I think healthy food can a good option for the school lunch menu.

In conclusion, the healthier school lunch menu would be a good idea because it will help a lot students in many ways including teachers, students, and all the people who works a the school, I think is a good idea to be healthy not just out of school also inside of the school, we just want to maintain our habits, and that can be good because, we are doing the right thing, and that is my opinion about the school lunch menu, we just want to improve with the school and doing this we will.",0
"Experience will help people to know how to face problems whenever they make a mistake. However pleople should make their own decisions and manage their ideas to do what they think is correct.

First, people should create their own ideas. Correct or incorrect decisions would make people more experienced. Reasonable people would make up good ideas, be careful with any kind of bad decisions, and use experience as a tool to success, and build a great future for them.. Think on how they want to improve and try new things. In fact, people know more about life when their experience is greater. Decide what people really want, and what can they really do, is very important, since not everyone is able to do what other people can do. Also seeking ideas from other people is not a very good thing when it won't benefit them. when trying to build a successful future, people should create their own ideas, make good decisions, and experiece new things by themselves to get more confident in their lifes. When people make good decisions they tend to be successful and encourage themselves to keep growing. That's why, experienced peolple are more likely to success than not experienced peolple in order of the kind of knowledge that they have.

In conclusion, people as builders of their own life, should be independent, and don't wait until someone tell them what to do, and how to do it. although, they have to follow their instincts, and don't led anybody disturb their mind. All individuals should follow their own instincts, and ideas. We can also say that people need time to think about any bad consequenses that can result from any of their decisions.

Third, people will get more experince. To understand what the role of life is, people should expand their ideas And work out more by themselves.

Second, people should make good decisions. Also, an important point of experience is that lessons of life won't led people make the same mistake over and over. Therefore, confidence is the key to make good decisions. In other words, people should decide what they really want",0
"If the students take a classes online this is benefit for them and have a lot adventages, and they can do the both things work and follow study in online classes and they can follow the goals like find a good job and finish his studies. Because students can lerning more, students can do a better work, and students can have a more time for to spend with the family. This is important and benefit because students can make a lot things, and they have a more time for make a lot things wathever they want. Should some school offer distance learning for students to attendend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. However, the classes in online is wonderfure because is a way to spend with the family because they can make a day fun with them and make differents things like play football, wath a movie, they can go to the cinemark and other places that they prefers.

In conclucion class online it's benefit from being able to attend classes from home. I need to work for buy my things, pay my house and my car. But if they study classes in online it's more easy not it's very hard like in the school.

Some people say that the classes online it's a lost time the student do not make nothing in his house, when they have classes online they lost time. . They can do a good investing for make a homework they can find a lot information, if the students are a relax and they have a time they only need to study a few hours no is like in the school. It's for these reason that I frefer class online, with these class I can have a lot time for me, and I can make my things and I can do the two things study and work.

The second reason is the students can do a better work, and they can have a better grade. For example when the students have more time, they can make a better work, because they are enfocus in his obligation like homework and proyects, and they want to be a good student is for that they can do effort for turn in a good proyects with the use the internet. Some people are agree with these class, because classes in online it's bennefit and better for students, students can learning more, students can do a better work, and students can have a more time for to spend with the family. In the school is more tired because they need to wake more early and they need to do a lot homework in the many classes. They can turn in a good homework or proyect with more information explained. For example, when they are in the house they play with the cell phone or they are using his phone for other things, and they not study and not learning like in the shool. If the students will can study in classes online they can have a big opportunities and they can follow his dreams and has the all they want to do or they want to has.

One reason it's classes in online is benefit and better, students can learning more and they can have in the house because they can do a time for make all things they needed make, for example I want to graduate and I want to follow study but it's difficult for me because I don't have time for anything I can't not make my homework, and study for my quizz",0
"When I work in groups sometimes I'm the one that has to do all the work, and in my opinion if we are working in groups we have to help each other, communicate and share our thoughts because if we don't do that what's the point of working in groups. What are the benefits of working with a group and working alone? I believe that working in groups helps you to have more ideas, more knowledge, because if you communicate with your group members, they'll think about different ideas to proceed the work that is getting done.                  . Working alone sometimes helps you more than working with groups because you are responsible for your own work.

I rather work by myself because I've had bad experience working with groups. For example, I'm a very shy person, it's rare the times I talk in class but when I'm in a group I have to talk, share my thoughts with my group members and communicate with them.

Reasons why I prefer working alone are: I focus more doing my own work, it's only my responsibility not others, I have to worry to turn it in on time, if i get a bad grade it's going to be my fault not others, I'm responsible for my own actions, I have to make sure if everything is right to get all the credit.

Reasons why I don't like to work in groups are: sometimes they're not responsible for doing their part, if they do their work they do it all messy( you can't even understand their hand writing), they play around too much because sometimes they take it as free time, they spend most of the time on their phone instead of doing what they are supposed to do, sometimes they don't do their part in time and we have to turn it in late and don't get all the credit.

I believe working in groups is beneficial but at the same time it's not, I think it depends with the people you work with, because if you work with people that do their work and actually care about school they will definitely be beneficial and make your group work out. However, I think working in groups is important because you can come out of your comfort zone and be free to share your thoughts with your group members, and you can make friends too. So you have to chose what's better for you and what's going to benefit you more, but for me I feel like working alone is more beneficial for me than working in groups. If you work with someone who doesn't care and is always playing around, you won't get anything done and will receive a bad grade unless you do all the work and the other person will just get credit by not doing anything, in that case there is no point to work in groups.

In conclusion, I believe it's more beneficial to work alone than groups because you can focus more on what you're doing and take responsibility of your own work, because if you don't take care of your school work nobody is going to do it for you",0
"For example I'm from Generic_City and all my family are Hispanic and our home language is Spanish, and speaking English its not easy for me, but I never thought that I was going to be able to speak it. I'll say, once my aunt told me ""Believe in what you can do, and not in what you can fail on"", she hasn't never give up on what she can achieve in her life. I think that success, are composed by failures, but not for everyone.

Success are for a better life, but to have a better life there will be always complicated things(FAILURES), that may be you will want to stop doing that thing that is going to help you to succeed.

The important role of failures on success is that, if you don't fail once you will not learn; failures plays that important part in success, learn is based on what you did wrong, I am saying based on wrong because If you did something wrong before, you learn that part, What do you did wrong? and next in the future you already know what you did wrong and now you will make it right.

Now, sometimes we give up so easy on what we want or on what we are fighting for, some loss the enthusiasm for the success and others not, I agree with that, some think different and if you think different about the failures its going to help you to make that success. I was failing in school and I felt so sick that I was giving up so easy and fast. I told myself that everything its possible in life, you born for a purpose, not just because your mom wanted you to be born.

There was a time, I got stress, anxiety and depression. Some people fails in their path because they dont understand the meaning of the failures.

In conclusion, I agree with the idea that Success consist of going from failure to failure, even if you loss your hopes or enthusiasm you got to keep going in your goal to succeed.

More than 50% of people, I will guess, fight for their future they put all their effort to succeed and if they can, we can. Failures come as a good parts of success to set it down and success in life.. There will be more than failures, there will be big obstacles and some times people will put traps in your path.

Some people will just want to see you fail in the field and some will be happy to see you in the top of the mountain. Failures can cause a lot of things like, feel hopeless, loss enthusiasm and giving up so easy for those who are weak, but if you are strong enough to believe that you are going to make it you will make it, you are going to have your levels of hope, enthusiasm and faith high that nothing will stop you to succeed.

Failures are more challenges added to your life, to be in the top of the mountain you should hike until you can see the ocean behind the mountain. I started to think positive, and do the things right, nothing last forever, I got rid of my depression but still with stress and anxiety, but from there to now it doesn't mean nothing for me. Failures comes one after one, and after one, that I told myself ""You are going to be okay, and you are going to do what you like and succeed and make your parents feel proud of you""",0
". That ways they can get credits for doing these classes.

imrove with their talents and go around the world. Drama is a great elective class because students get to move around and have fun and dance. For example, if you also can be in a art contest in your school or anywhere else.

Secondly, students can do these classes. Also, it helps with credits by it could take them to a different better collage.

Lastly, these classes are better to take as an elective class because they can perform in events in school like drama. However, music is also a great elective class because it could help you like in school and anywhere else because they know how you sing. But, music is not only singing students can also play insterment like giutar, flut and many more. Also, art can do things for the student because while time pass and they are great in drawing it could take him or her to collage it could make better digree collage. So, student can also impress them with insterment. I think that students should take a art, muisc, and drama class. For example, students can impress their family with their amzaning talent. Art is a great elective class because tehy can have more credits and they can learn more interesting things in that class. Also, they can do it on their free time and as their elective class. Also, with their talent they can go to different countriesand perform their and other places too and preform too.

In clousion, this is why students should take art, music, drama as their elective class. Cause by taking these classes they can learn more about what happens ineach classes. Also, if they do one of those classes they can recive credits on their GPA.

First reasoon, student can learn what happens in that class like art",0

"                                          . Personally I do agree with Prime Minister Churchill many times on my life I have fail, and fail again but I got up because I knew that there was a good price at the end. beginning of 2015 that season I was chosen as team captain and I played all the games all that hard work was worthy at the end.

It dosen't matter how many times I failed I never lose my enthusiasm because in life we are going to have many failures and we will feel life given up but we most get up and keep going it doesn't matter how many times we lose a battle our main goal must be win the war because just like Churchill failed again, and again but at the end he won the war with his people I also failed in my team again, and again but I won my own war at the end. After three long months of recovery after was heal I started once again training harder, eating healthy, going to the gym more often getting ready for the next season. Back in 2014 it was my first day on the soccer academy

I been playing soccer as a defender all my life but this time it was my first time training in such a good team I started training every day make some friends too. A few days later the first game came I was not on starting line up or on the bench I wasn't even call for the game I was upset but I though that it was because I was new in the team, or the coach didn't know me well. Halfway during the season one of the the starting defenders left the team and I knew it was my chance I started and I play all the game and I didn't just prove my coach that capable more importantly I prove my self. The next day during practice my coach call me out and told me if you wanted a spot on the team you need to work harder after that day I knew I needed to start training more, going to the gym more often, and I start eating more healthy a few days later during practice I started seeing results I was getting stronger, faster, and skillful a few weeks later I got called for the teams fourth game but I was not in starting eleven I was sitting on the bench the all game I was upset I though I was failure once more but I never gave up and the next day I was back practice, eating more healthy, going to they gym more often. 'Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.''-Churchill once said this phrase during WW2 to tell his people that it didn't matter how many battles Britain was going to lose but that they were going to win the war. Later during the season in one of the last games in one play I dislocated my arm and that meant that I was out for the rest of the season. Humans now at days think that life is all about planing the future, and they all just trying to avoid problems, trying to live only winning but to reach success there must be a long journey of lost battles, of big problems but you must stay put because it does not matter how many times you fall you most get up again, and again.

My Dad once told me ''Always try never give up''",0
"Because the majority of people might be mad when from somthing when we see them from the first time, I disagree with this statement because most people chang there impressions when they're in a spicific mood, Some might change after a proplem has been solved. and to affect especially forcibly or deeply to some one's mind when they see some one impressions for the first time.

I encorage everyone to change thier opinion about the first impression are almost impossible to change. To see someone impression, that might be possible to chang. Because when I was yonger from now my dad allways use too tell me

""too mach agreement kills a chat"". People's reactions might chang after an accident happen to some one's in the past It can be a very big and huge chang for some one's reactions if we see them the next time or day. So to see people impression we have to see thier past and what they been throw, Many of them change there mood, and some might change after a prolem has been solved.. Places and moumints can be on of the reasons why people impressions are mostly can change by this way, This kind of things might be wired to be impossible. To see people's impression, I have to look at them when they are in thier good time that will chang the ideas. Because the majority of people impression can chang etheir over time or by the area sourounding them, and figer out how make time to understand how it goes and how people thier features from influence by the socity around us and how I said can give the impress with your senserity follow people's impressions, and literally the word impression is the sence of feeling in how someones feeling from sirten situation.

Seeing the reality, Most humans have their way of reactions to react to every thing they can show or chang by somehow in their life, In this period of time no one like to listen to someone's story, Real people who shows their impressions by the area sourounding them it effects us as who we are and the time that we are in, So the place that we are often been can effect our impressions, The place that we been raised in can impact on our impression. Emotions and there behavioral changes in some bodeis deppend on how they think by a word or emotinal apperance can be changed with their behavioras, and some might be in need so bad for somthing and that can also shows their impressions behavioral chang.

When I was in my country many people came to the area where we live there was so many that your mind can't relate to what we see and we all were very nice to them and we gave them many of the things that we have and as much we can, There was so many kids from them I use to be realy sad when I see them like that I refused to give every thing I can to them but some of them was vrery hungry and some are mean but I said to my self in my mind that their impreesion won't be like that if they weren't in need like that. Many peple chang thier imperssions after the first time we see them.

So I have a frined who allways chang her mood by any time, some times she would come to my house and knock on the door even if we were just argued about something, but when I saw her the first time when we met she was very nice and my parent invited her to my house and her first time her impression was very happy and intersted to see us and learen about our culture, so when I saw her the next day we were so happy that we met. and I told her my trip how we came to the US, she was so impress to know more about us, But some time she woluld change becaus of her parents and when she's sad she comes to my house and tell me how she has been and how her family is with her, and I was listen to her as she tells me every thing, But when some one come to our house and see's her like that they say that she's wired from how she acts, but her first imression was't like that, she changes with what impact throw her life, and we're a teens also, Every day my parents sees her they say that she's very talented because she has a very good voice and I use to be so happy to see her singing because she had a good voice, but her impreesion changed after I saw her how she reacts with others, and I use to get surprised of how she's diffeent with methen others, but now I found that people are like a door each person need a spacial key to open them and understand how they feel and think",0
"It is not just picking up trash. Letter to Principal:

Some of my friends perform community service, but my other friends think it just waste of time. You will need a helping hand to help you with community service.

In streets, public places, and school campus, there are people littering. Your community will be cleaner and fresh. So every stu. Community service is like a helping hand. So, when you are done picking up the trash, you could continue planting trees and flowers. To make it stand out.

In conclusion, everyone should have the pride to carry out community service. When your community is full with trash. Community service helps you and your community.

There are many reasons why students should perform community service. There are planting trees, etc. Even if the trash is not yours, pick it up. Students should know that community service is very important. Not just students but everyone in this country should have community service. Performing community service helps your community and other communities. No one will care, but you can make a change. If you care about your community, you should gather people to help you clean it. This is a great way to show to the community that you care. I am supporting that the principal should require students to perform community service",0
"For some reasons, some students that go to school can't be focused on their studies/activities because they are distracted by some of their classmate that is very naught. For instance, there are some people that born in this world that are very naught, like even you defy him/her they will not listen to you and then sometimes, some of the other students will raise their pride and just walkout from their class because they don't want to listen any objection from their action. For example in today's society, a lots of bad things happening in the world, like school shootings that cause a lot of innocent students to die, like what happened in Florida, a few months ago. Attending classes from home by the way of online or video conferencing can really benefit to the students because one of the biggest benefits is that, they are more safer to study in their homes, they have a great time to focus in their studies, and they can avoid bad influence from others.. Are you one of the students that is home schooled? If not, here are some of the benefits, why some students choose to attend classes in their home, by the way of online or video conferencing.

Some people believe students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home, however, home school is a great way of student to attend classes because they can focus in their studies, it's more safer, and they can avoid bad influence from others.

Attending classes through online or video conferencing has a lot of benefits like what I mention from the first paragraph, that homeschooling can help students to focus in their studies. One of the reason also of homeschooling is that, they can avoid bad influence from others. Another reason for home schooling is that, it's more safer for them to study. Like for example, some of the school are diverse ethnic, students characteristics are diverse also, like some of the other likes to go shopping mall, likes to strolling anywhere, likes to bully others, likes to fight, likes to not go home after school instead go to other houses that they don't really even that much know, and many more characteristics.

Although students will have benefits of attending classes from school, however, attending classes from home has much more benefits",0
"                                      . THE SUCCESS OF LIFE

the success of hes life is through because when you are star every time you failure and failure,but the that failure you learn how you continue your life but and your road you see are new failure and you are star again but like that you learn how to continue your life; because and your future the that failure you are stay there because you know how you attack that fail the you have and your life and try to find the we ideas what are you like and don't forget the you have your family and ask questions if you have or are your friends the more closed you, but don't forget in time have a person they said if your friends but that person is try to destroy you because he or she have a jealousy you because he see the you have more opportunity then you try try to change your opinions and your goals but never follow that directions the that person.

When you have a opportunity take that because that is your like, Try to have a new opportunity and get that before other person have the same carrier not keep your goal because if that person get first that carrier your life change because you said my carrier stop here because other person won the job first them me,like in my life I have a job but in times is so burn and them said I one to change my job a other more better because not pay me the enough to work their like the all week I work 5 days the that 5 days I work 4 days for my self and is not to easy to clean everything for my self I took with my boss to find a another employed, but she said no because this mouths is not business and thats why she no can to find a another employed to help me, to this point I failure because a not won enough money to help at my mom like pay the rent or help and another object.

the enthusiasm they show you, the you never due back you need to go at front the everything you never give you secrets at others person because that person use and you give him more opportunities he you have thats why you never when I said never give your secrets at person because is like you give your goals house, car and including the family , because all at that person;the enthusiasm dislike your first goal because that help you at can work you get your goals and studying is the most important because as you not study you never get you want to want because the study is the most important in your life, the your grades in your schools demonstrate if you fight for yours dreams or you want to work and never work the you like it, because in times you have a negatives times you go away the you road.

The negatives things is take the wrong way,because in times you have a persons jealously they try the you not stay more up the thats persons and try the you go down but never follow that directions the that person because affected your job or your company or and you want to work and don't forget what yo like the have family and friends they help you and friends the your ask if you have a question.

"The only thing I can do is go in Google or YouTube so it can help me. every game i have passed the ball.

when you have a problem its your chance to try/succeed. The coach always got mad at me for not passing the ball. Sometimes I gave up because I forget to pass the ball. If the other team has it I attack to get the ball but when I get it on my feet I cant pass because its hard. when theres a problem its a chance for you to do your best. There was no way that I can remember to bass the ball. I search up ""why do I never pass the ball and how can I get better to pass or not forget to pass the ball."" It helped me a lot and now I started trying my best to get better at soccer and its going good so far. Sometimes I don't know what to do to get better, its hard watching YouTube or going to Google is the only thing I can do to get batter, or not forget to pass, and help me. when you have a problem you need to try your best, try not to give up, and try not to get confuse or it will be even harder for you.. I agree with this statement because when you in a problem you give up, you dont know what to do, and you try your best to find out why its hard or why its a problem.

when I play soccer there was one problem, I never passed the ball to my teammates. The coach always tells me in every game to pass the ball.

I dont know what to do to remember to pass the ball",0
"In conclusion, we should keep the school days and school hours as it is. With extending two hours of school day, this system had effect students educational life. If we extend two hours of school day, then students would not be able to focus on their education, because the brain cells need a break and need to refresh itself. . If we want to focus and have good attendace, therefore we should not extend the school hours. This idea had discrease the number of attendance and the grades of most of the students.

Finally, the regular school days and regular school hours are more beneficial then the new idea of extending two hours of school. Students are not showing up to school and they skip school because of the new system. By extending two hours of school day, students for sure need to take a rest, take a shower, some students need to do chores, and also focus on their goals after school. Therefore, we are comparing the grades and attendance of students. Should our school extend the school day two hours? No, I strongly disagree with extending two hours to school day. Furthermore, if there is 4 days of school and 3 days of no school, then students will forget what they studied 3 days ago.

In Afghanistan, schools adopted a four-day school week, with each day consisting of ten hours",0
"The way you are approached.

My Experiences can be said some of my first impressions can be hard to change, or I can be wrong about someone and my first impressions can be way off,and that person turns out to be nothing like what I have thought. Everyone makes first impressions of people before even getting to know them by the way they dress, and looks. This statement can be argued from two sides. Based on my experiences, I disagree with this statement, first impressions are made by everyone but it is not impossible to change. But than theirs many other people whos first impressions are changed.

In conclusion, I believe that first impressions can be changed by my perspective, It is hard for someone to change the way they think of someone, but thats why its called ''first thoughts'' because it can be changed over time the way you look at someone can start to be seen differently and your thoughts will change.    . There is a lot of people in this world whos first impressions are impossible for them to change and would never change. Some first impressions can be changed and some can't be.

First impressions is a human thing, I believe that everyone has at least made a first impression of someone and their first impressions can be impossible for them to change or it can be changed. Sometimes it can be impossible to change what your first thoughts can but than other times it can be changed.

One major first thoughts of a person can be the way a other person dresses, the way they look they way the walk, the way they talk. The way someone's appearances can be affected by first impressions by so many ways. Your first thoughts of someone. There are so many things a person can have first thoughts about a human being and just assume things about before even getting to meet . That is a major cause that is first seen. It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change",0
"My teacher have worked hard with me to provide me with guidance and the skills I need to be smart in life.

Thatswhy,

I think people should ask for help and guidance from their parents and teacher before making important life decisions. They help me look at both the good and bad things about different job. For instance, after I graduate from high school and earn my diploma I will ask my teacher about the possibility of going to a community college or taking extra classes to help me get a good job that will make me happy and provide me with skills make so that I can live a better life. Their advice help me make better decisions. Both my parents and my teachers know my strengths and weaknesses and can help me in making the best decisions.. I appreciate their knowledge because they know me very well and want the best for me. Therefor, I thing It' is important to ask for their guidance in these matters.

Secondly, I would ask not only my family, not also my teachers when I make decisions about my education. They bring up things that I may have not thought about. For example, when I consider getting another job,I like to discuss my options with my parents. Should people make their own decision, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters ? Some people value self reliance and feel the need to follow their own instincts and ideas. Although these people are confident and trust themselves,I believe people should ask for advice from their parents and other professionals before making important life decisions.

First of all, most people respect and value their parents",0
"For me, I would choose helping the community, 'cause if you think about it, your actually doing it for your own goods, maybe in some points your not, but most of them from peoples personal experiment's basically, your doing it for your community and your country, the world and people that are around you. I mean if they're eight-graders, they should be smart enough and decide on their own on what they want, or don't want to do. Later on, I'll be a famous tutor! If I'll be doing a good job at tutoring, I might starting subbing for teachers, then they'll ask me to be a teacher! Which means, that now I'll have a job! So basically, I made my own personal carrier just for helping the community! What I'm trying to say, helping you community isn't as bad. Then, I might start tutoring my cousins or neighbors, something to start of with, like a practice. For example, I'll pick, helping students in your classrooms. In my personal opinion, I think that students should decide on their own. What i would do, I would make a list from easiest, to hardest on helping the community, and start from the easiest because at first, your not used to it, and you need to learn how to be responsible for your things, and for what you do. If I'll see or think that I'm good enough, I might move on, tutoring Elementary kids. If your one of the lucky ones, you'll make your self a carrier, if not, keep on trying! And one important thing to no is, keep on trying, what you give, is what you'll receive.",0
"And he thinks it will better for the next day but the manager just gives him these jobs and no more. So, he will manage by the marketing manager and he so happy about that. For instance, a person who live with his family and he recognizes that he likes to become the doctor in the future because his family want it. Because he just graduation and he wants to become the employer in this company. Although people have their own decision, people should not being themselves are great accomplishment because sometime they need to change and over time people have done the tasks they hate.

First of all, people have their own decision. So, people should not being themselves because they do not know exactly about themselves. He hopes it will make his life better and can complete his dream later.

Also, sometime they need to change. Inside of each people always has the right and the wrong sides. Of course, they will feel boring and nonsense. Everyday, he is so busy and he does not has times for his family and himself. They want to do with something else. Also, they can not do anything they like while living with their family before. Because he know it is a modern world and has many things to do and worries. Absolutely, he knows what he wants to do. When they go out to work they need to follow all the rules of the life. So, he hates it but he never give up because it is the rules of life. Some people want to become another one to success. But when he do this job for the long times and he feels that he does not has more interest. So, they force to finish it while they do not like. Another lesson for that is something they hate is not mean they give up or not finish it because it is a part of testing in the life. So, he put his dream on the side and focuses on the job. He recognizes that help him too much to create more skills and learn more experiences.

Thus, people should not being themselves are great accomplishment. However, they live in the modern world and have many things to worries. Sometimes, they need to change to know the outside of the world have more fun than if they just stay at one place. Task is the mission from the boss give them to completing. For example, a man who has a dream that he can travel around the world. However, not being themselves should not change the physical world. For the first day, the manager just wants him to do some work likes buy the coffee, copy papers... Some people they never change their life, and they just live by the rules. After thinking about that, he wants to do the jobs that makes him comfortable and can enjoy the wonderful life.

In addition, over time people have done the tasks they hate. Some of them just live and do anything they like when they success. When they look at another people they can learn more lessons and experiences in life. If a person being themselves then they just want to do anything they know and do not care another person. For example, a trainee person who is young and do not have an experience in the job. That make they think if they should being themselves or not. So, we know that many people are accomplishment by their own decision but only for who are smart or brave challenge themselves. So, he knows work to lives, not lives to work. Just do the best they can and maybe they can accomplishment if not being themselves.. He always thinking about it but he can not",0
"i like reading diary of a wimpy kid,and comic's my favorite was diary of a wimpy kid dog days it was about a kid named greg getting his first dog and not knowing how hard it is to take care of it.

if you don't like reading alone their are some things called bookclubs if you don't know what they are they are a group of people friends,family ext and they read the same book as you and talk about it they tell predictions,summarys, if you are wondering where the bookclubs could be located in librarys or you can make your own wiyh your friends or family. I think reading would be a enjoyable educational activity because you might find a book very intresting to you and it will also help your brain better at reading. some people are into alot of different genre's like comedy,or horror,drama,ext. and the best thing about reading you can do it anywhere like at school,friends house,airport ext. and this is what i thinks is a enjoyable educational activity.. reading is fun and also educational but it all depends on the person because some people might not like reading they could like reading when they are adults",0
"If it's happening but you dont want it to happen then stop it. Well then if they ask you to do that then you know that you have to ask every one in the school to sign the paper if you really don't want this to happen. Finally not that much people would come to school they would not like it even more.

Some ways you might like this is that. However there is going to be some one to not like you idea and they might go wrong for you but I think you can get this.

So now that you know how to do this it say do it. See if other student want to join you if they want less day of the school year or a another day addend to the week end like a Monday because every hates Mondays right. You learn a lot more thing for next year which is really help full for the next year of classes you have.    . Finally you simply like school you like seeing friends in school and you like learning more things.

How you may be able to stop it? will first you have to go to your principle and him/her how you can you stop this form going on well they might say get a exact amount of people to sign a paper. Most likely be that people will get tired really fast. However think what is going to happen if i do it so think what your going to do before you do it. However if it's not that much people yet you know you have to go to every one in the school asking them if they dont want a hours and a half to be added and at the end of that i might have the number you need of people.

Do you want this to happen at your school but your school isnt do it? Well like the other one go to your principle and ask them if they can add another hour and a half but and another day to your week end or less day of the school year. First you know you got to go to you best friends and people that dont really like to stay in school that long. They might add a day to the week end which would be more days per week end that sounds good to me. If you want this to happen then ask your principal if this can happen in any way. If you want it to happen in your school then do it. What if your school wanted to add one hours and a half would you agree or disagree? I presently think that no one would like that like dont like that idea at all and let me tell you why I would int like that. Another thing that they can do is add lease day to the school year I think that people would really like that and other ways are. If a lot of people agrees you might get this to happen in you school. First if you dont like school that much like me you would do what ever you can to stop that",0

"We can easily contact to the others by texting, calling as technology is developing . It is a best way to know our friends, family members' activities without asking because we don't have too much time to speak with them everyday. We can read news on the websites, or watch the agenda to update more things everyday so we can have better knowlegde about things around us. Using technology in general and social media in particular also can help us make friends. Lots of people also use it to play game, chat with their friends, or shopping online to relax after a hard-working day.

With technology, we can find and do almost things we need so we can save our times and will have more times to do the other activities like spending time with family, or hanging out with friends.

Second, technology helps us adpot hot problems, new informations of society faster and easier. This showed the major of technology and the care of people give to the others.

Many people said the use of technology has the limitation of human contact, and it's not all right. In short, technology can limit human contact or not based on us so let's try using it as limited as we can and don't forget to use it right ways, right times, and right purposes.. As we know, technology has became one of the most important things in our lives, and people now are abusing the use of technology and forgetting to contact with the others around them. People often use Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat to add friends over the world and follow them. "" Has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had a positive or negative affects on people's lives?"". For example, students use technology to serve for their learning like stuyding online or researching important things for their lessons. Otherwises, we still have to speak face to face to the others as much as possible so we can understand them better, and it also shows our care to them.

Not only technology, everything in the world also has both positive and negative sides, and the main idea is ourselves. If we use technology for the right purposes, and can limit the time of using it, technology will be very useful to our lives. Besides, many poor people have been helped by the others because the news about them have been shared wide-spread. Although it has both positive and negative affects on people, but we cannot declaim that our lives have been easier and better since we have had techonlogy.

First, technology are used everyday by people at all ages because of its functions. We can complete many things online by using technology such as study, entertain, shopping, etc",0
"Others can conduse issues more than solve them, at times. An over-sized black hoodie and a regular sized white hoodie. The thought of, what am I going to do, to make my essay satisfied so I can succeed? You feel like you need to find information yourself, managing your stress and time. Self-reliance allows one to follow their own path and makes their own decisions. With guidance it can be helpful, it can also be misleading and people aren't completely following their instincts. The process of thinking about your ideas.

Our stance on the matter of self-reliance in humans stans to show people need to be self reliant because it is good to not distinctly require independence on any other. Guidance is helpful if there are no choices that the person sees that needs it. People are capable of making their own decisions. In our minds we think about different things in a situation, the good and the bad. Although guidance makes you sound weak, but we want to be satisfied with our decisions. With self-reliance, one is more keen on their own inabillities and strives to problem solve with a more in-depth and notable understanding.. These types of situations is what most people struggle with, but this helps people benefit from themselves.

We all value self-reliance to the fact that if someone makes their own decisions they have to solve the problem. People who are self-reliance are capable of doing the same tasks they are in. Like when we shop, you choose between two or more pieces of clothing. The prices are in the same range, a worker comes up to you asks if you need assistance. Then you feel like you're being held back by people who offer advice.

When I read my prompt for this essay, I struggled coming up with ideas and examples. In nature, most animals get to be self-reliance in order to stay alive, for example, as bear gets older, their parents have to let them go alone in the wild.

We have voices in our minds that we talk to, and get really indecisive",0
"I chose to do landscapes because I like to paint

I like to see the color and how they are mixted that's so cool. The type of work I would like to have is a stalyst professional and paint landscapes.

Stalyst professional is a really good job you get a lot of money only doing hairstyles.

Painting landscapes is a really good job too because you are doing what you want doing a really good art and a lot of people like how it looks like they pay a lot of money for the landscapes if you do a really good job.

I chose stalyst professional because is interesting to do, you learn a lot about girls hairstyles and boys hairstyles I think is a really good job because a lot of people likes to do hairstyles and people likes to do haicuts because there is a lot of different things for example new hair color or a new hairstylt and stalyst is a really good job because you get a lot of money and you can do whatever you want with your own money but working hard.

I think the workplace will be in a place that there is a lot of people, because when is people they are interesting to have new haistyles for example if someone goes to have a new hairstyle and is really cool people are going to wish have the same hairstyle or a different hairstyle.

People are going to be really happy to have a new hairstyle because some people are bored to have the same haircut and if is a place with a lot of people they are going to love that place.

I chose doing landscapes because is interesting for a lot of people, because if you do a really good lanscapes people are going to love it and they are going to be interest to have one.

landscapes are so beutiful because you see how the paints are combinated houw the color are mixted and you see a really cool landscape. I li9ke to paint landscapes because I

I also like to paint landscapes because I love acrilic paints and how they mix and how they work.. The work for the landscapes with acrilic paint it looks really nice because it looks realistic, and that's interesting for people that like to have landscapes.

I think the workplace for landscapes is like where is a lor of people that like to see landscapes and buy them because landscapes are so pretty",0
"Probaly through arts, music, or even drama they'll be able to express them out to the world. Some people belive that students should be required to take a music, a drama, or an art clases. Some students are really good at arts, and some are good at music, while the others are good at drama. students should take these clases because they're part of our daily activity. Through this subjects many people are rich today, and many people was able to let what had been in them for years upon years out, so they should be required for students.

For instance: Beyounce, Rehanna, Nici and so on. As for me music and art should really be allowed in schools because through those subjects people will be able to express their grievances.

Some people may say these clases should not be require for students to take and such clases should be electives because not evryone are good at them.

Well it's true, but these clases are really helpful to the society because not everyone have the face or the abilies to really express their emotional feelings to peolpe, however, people have their passed life stories to tell, but they don't know how to let them out. Should students be required to take a class in arts, or should such clases be electives?

I belive that students should be require to take these clases because it plays a great rolls in our lives. I believe that through arts and music, or even a drama, people are able to express their emotional feelings, or their passed lives. I believe those people didn't just come up to become rich today they study music because that was their goals in life.

In summary, music, arts, and drama should be required for students to take, and such clases shouldn't be electives in school or for students.. So such clases should be allowed in schools for students to take.

I also agree with those that says that students should be required to take clases like art, music, and drama because some students wants to become an artistic, some wants to become a musician, while the others want to be a dramatist, so it should be allowed in school for students to take them",0
"They can also learn new stuff that later on can help them in life.

Another thing that the older kid can learn is to talk to people without being scared or shy this can also help them by getting a job when they grow up. One thing it can help them with is learning new thing from the older kids somethings they can learn from them is like how to do math,homework, and how to act in the middle of class without being rude to the teacher. It can also teach them how to talk to other people without being scared or shy to talk with someone or i front of the class.

Programs like this can help both young kids by making new friends with the older kids or talking to other kid and making friends that way. Talking to the young kids can help them learn about the kid and how they act in class and around other people.

It can also help younger students in many ways. This can also help the older kid see how the younger kids act and see with they need any help during class with work like reading ,writing or math.

Many programs for kids can help them in many ways by teaching them many new things that can help them later on in life or when they need help they know how to do something because they had learned in from some one older i their past and maybe later on he can help other people by teaching them how to do stuff they didnt know how to do..

"People has been using video conferencing to even take tests at home.

Distant learning would also help them have success in education socially. If students are to stay at home to learn, they would feel more comfortable around somewhere they been for a long time. It's beneficial for students to do distant learning more than to go to school and do it.

Distant learning is already being used through online and video conferencing, This days colleges and universities allows students to choose online courses of their own choices . Students are used to online stuff like, web browsing, gaming, and etc. They wouldn't have to do any of this, and have enough sleep to have a fresh mind to work with.

It is beneficial for students to use distant learning to attend classes such as, video conferencing and online browsing. which gives them an extra advantage already. They could ask people, family members who they are comfortable with, for help if they wanted to. I personally think that its better for me and lots of other students to use distant learning as it can help in a social and educational way. They would be more successful using online browsing. They would be more comfortable with it as they are used to it . They would be more fit and ready than going to school considering that you have to wake up early in the morning, get ready and walk to school. Video conferencing is another way of distant learning; this would let the teachers talk to students in case they need help. This generation is influenced by technology and they are used to it.                          ",0
"Counsulers can help you look for colleges or universities that you wan to attened. Have a talk with them and ask he or she questions about what do you do in your job, how much does your job pay you, how much do you make a year, if they can take you where they work at and see the other employees there and have conversations with them. Help other students who want to have your career as well. When you are looking for colleges you have to check how much you have to pay to attend the college, how much do you have to pay a month. That's why some teenagers start working while they are in high school, so they can start saving money for college. They have worked hard to get where they are today and they have jobs that they enjoy doing making money and living their best life.

You should start looking for colleges when you are in your junior year of high school because. The libary is a great place as well you can find books that match up with your career ask they libarians to help you find the right book. Some jobs will help you pay for the college that you will be attending at.

As we read this is why i think students should start pickcing their future careers while they are in high school because. Its good to talk people who has the same career that you are studying for because. Students should start picking a career when they entered high school, so they can pick classes in school or ask teachers to help you with your career.

If students start picking a career at a young age they will already have an idea of what to do, they can do research about their career at school. You can also have your counsuler set up a meeting with you and your parents to talk and see what they can do for you.

If you know anybody who has the same career that you want to have. So they will have a plan ready after they graduate high school, go to college, graduate from college, and start looking for jobs of the career that you choosed. Some parents pay the college for their kids, but i think its better if you pay some of that money with your parents, so they don't have to waste all of their money for you to go college. You can ask your counsuler any questions to help you set up a plan after you graduate high school, talk about why you choosed this career for you, do you have some experiences with this career yet, what do your parents think about this career that you want to have. If you have an older siblings that have already gradated high school and have their career they can talk to you and help you out and to tell you what to do.

School counsulers are great people to talk when your looking for a career. And eventually they will become successful as you are for making the good choices while you were in high school.. You can even ask your parents to help you with your career by giving you some advice to help you out. You can talk them to help them out, answer all the questions they have to ask you, tell them what to do you are looking for colleges to help with their career, show them where you work and show how your job is. how much do people with your career make, what does this career do, how much do they make a year",0
"Some people are accomplish of your hard work , some people never care others people hard work they just say thanks without meaning it and can say stuff behind your back.

Although humans think they doing the right thing, they aren't we should be a world without cruel no one knows how damage a person can be and fake it just because they want to accomplish the work they have to turn in or be finish with because they will know that if they don't finish the work it would be harder for them to get rid of you with your negativity. We should all be a group of good people and do the right things the right way. Can't you imagine how many kids needs our help and we might see them with some eyes that we think there okay but they are really not. For example people don't serve Hispanics equally for differences but most of us have but our effort on work hard to earn some cents to take to our family but no one sees that all they do is put there own rude opinion on us. We can make this world different if we stand up for others and help the world who need help and accomplish them with needs they need and everything would be different and make people think different.. Humans have the benefit to change and become a different person and accomplish a goal to become someone grateful for little things and make the world a different place with different though.

We should take a position to serve people with kindness, respect and give them a hand for there need of help sometimes helping others can make you a great person you can never know one day you will need the help of someone too and you will feel how much it hurts to not receive help from others or by someone you though wold of help you out you should always tell people how grateful you are for having them because they will realize you once helped them and they will help you out on the need of help, they will serve you as how you will serve them by now on, you can't judge a book by it's cover,

Thomas Jefferson wrote "" Determine never to be idle.."" and what i think about what that means is that you should not be ungrateful and you should help others, with simple words that are accomplishments.

The studies of

Thomas Jefferson old days history probably were different they did things differently and though different ladies suffer in the old days, now everything is sort of different they accomplish women for the things they do and treat us better than how women were treated back in the days ,

Thomas Jefferson wants things to be different and probably doesn't want people to do the same mistakes they did in time of history. If humans were different by showing others there help and respectful this world would of make every single thing differently. In my opinion

Thomas Jefferson wrote a statement that makes people think that, there's people out there who don't accomplish if we are doing something or we are not doing something. No one is grateful for peoples struggles and hard work they may thank you but they won't mean it.

Imagine being in a world where people thank you for every single thing that makes you feel respected and needed for more work and accomplish what we suffer for and we do it because of the need of some personal struggles your going through. We shouldn't care what others say as long as you know your a great person with a huge heart your good.

It would be wonderful how much may be done if we are always accomplishing others people work and being grateful for peoples effort, it would be a great idea if every single person listen to our life story before talking",0
"The community would be better if we keep going a head. and think about the future. Emerson about his writing. and if you do not try you are closing you mind and the opportunity to learn. Yes he does. Many people in society just want to focus in one thing. The author want to let the people know that there's many way to grow up. I agree with Mr.            . Unless you you try something beyond what you have already mastered. The people should think about to do different stuff even if they are mastered in any profession.

Does Mr. The people should think about to grow up.

In my conclusion the people should try something else. The society shouldn't be focus in just one stuff all life. He thought a bout it because he clearly is talking to the people in his writing. you will never grow. Emerson thought about the people when he wrote his message in his text. Also if you never try something new you will never know. The author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. unless you try something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.

Why the author Waldo Emerson wrote. but that affect the development of the community of work. People shouldn't stop learning other stuff or do other kinds of work because they are professional in one job",0
"The disadvantage might be that people might spend too much time watching video games or a new episodes from their favorite comics characters. It would be helpful for students to find any kind of information on internet when they forget their computers or other devices that they might use as a resource to find information. Those students who agree to have cellphones in school and do not accomplish the rules in how to use their cellphones properly, they will be playing around while they are in class, listen to music, and probably they will be texting with their friends. One of the reason why I believe that should be allowed is because cellphones are very useful and helpful for me in many ways. Another percent of the population spend their time in YouTube which that YouTube brings us some advantage and disadvantage. For those who use their cellphones in a properly way will say that cellphones are going to help them more than what teachers expect. In my situation I speak Spanish as my first language and when I do not understand a word I go to my cellphone and I translate the word and then I try to understand what the word means. Students also can give an example to other students that cellphones are little machines that help us in everyday lives, and they also might be giving advice to students in how they can be benefited from chance that the school provides to them.

On the other side why cellphones should not be allowed in schools is because schools think that students will not use their cellphones in a right path, and they will become more addictive to their cellphones where social media it's included. Cellphones should be allowed because that might help students to communicate with their parents if they have any kind of emergency while they are in school. They also believe that some of them will use their cellphones to finish homework that is not for their class and will cause that students will not be paying attention in what the teacher is saying. The advantage might be the tutorials that can help us to find information, how to fix something that you are capable to repair, and how to provide some skills from something that you like. But some students do not understand when they have to use their cellphones and when I see students listening to music it does distracted me because I am trying to concentrate in what the teachers is explaining because If I don not pay attention it is hard to understand later on. Most of the population have shown that a big percent of the population use their cellphones to spend their time in social media, whether is Facebook, Twitter, and Instragram. I strongly agree that school should allow students to have cellphones because it does provide a lot of advantages. For example some of the students who speak Spanish and they do not understand what the word say, they directly go to their cellphones and translate the word. I also use my cellphone when I do not have my computer with me, and I do my classwork with my cellphone, and then I turn my work in. Some teacher do not bother them if a student have a cellphone or not because they think that as long the student is doing his homework and classwork, they are going to be fine.

I believe cellphones should be allowed in schools, but under supervision of the teachers and principles. I also see how teachers get mad when a student do not obey when they have to put their cellphones away, and then the student start to argue with the teacher. Teachers also say that students will be texting in class and some of them playing video games and then when they tell them to put their cellphones away, they do not obey and some of them insult the teacher. Some of this students also will help them to find whatever meaning of a word that they do not understand. . For some students will be annoying to have cellphones in class because it is going to be a distraction even if they are not using their cellphones.

From other perspective teachers might believe that is wrong to have cellphones in class, whether they are using it in a proper way or not because they might believe that it's a distraction for every students, and even if they are good students they will use their cellphones while teachers are explaining some important information. Then they start to use it in some sentences to challenge themselves and improve their English. Another reason to not use cellphones in school is because when there is a fight between two students, they start to take pictures or videos of the fight rather than prevent and called anyone who can help.

Most of the student will agree to have cellphones in schools because some of them use their cellphones in a right path and some of them do not. There are going to be some students who speak different language as their first language and it is very helpful to have cellphone while they are in school. Another reason is that students will have the advantage to use their cellphones while they are in the middle of the class, and it means that those schools trust students that they use their cellphones properly during class and they are proving to others schools that student can be trusted to use their cellphones during classes",0
"First, student would not concentrate in school if they got out an hour and a half late. Student's who participate in a sport may have to leave class early to go practice for an up coming game making them miss half and hour or more of education.

What is your opinion?                      . Some student's may need time to do homework, go places that take a long time, or just make up time to study. Do you think school's should extend the school hours? Well, I disagree. Making them stress out over knowing that they would have to wake up early and be dismissed late.

Third, the education time of some student's may be cut short. This may happen when some student's are in a sport or they just need to leave school early. If schools were to add more time the students would not get enough sleep because they stayed up late studying for a quiz, test, or just homework causing the students or the other classmates to sleep during classes

Second, it would affect the mental health of the students",0
"Have you ever ask yourself why do some people are always are their home never go out to socialize with others? Since technology appear in the world, the life of millions of people got a easier way to live, because it brought most of the things and supplies that we need to make our life better and easier.

In my opinion i think technology has positive effect in people's live specially in young people, because teens who are in school have more opportunities to learn a get the skills that they need for their future, they have access to computers at their school to get more information about their classwork and the benefit to take classes or tests online without even attending to school.

Technology allows you to communicate with others without having contact, you dont need to be face to face to communicate with others, it brings people the facilities for those who dont have time to go out to buy the things that they need online like clothes or grocery without going to the store, and the capability to invent things that humans cant do.

However technology has negatives effects too, have you ever seen a little kid playing with toys like before technology was invented, you can see kids of 5-10 years old that already have a phone or video game console , they are addicted to it but not only kids young people too, therefore people can lose their vision by using it to much but its not the fault of technology its our own responsibility to take care of our health.

Technology affects peoples life by reducing their contact with others but at the same time it brings a lot of benefits to our generation and the future.",0
"I think that students should bring phones to school but turn then off and put them in their locker.

If the students don't do that job they might be in a big problem. in SCHOOL_NAME if the students do not turn theirs phone off and it rings during class the teachers automatically will take the phone from the students.

Eventually the parents have to come and get the phone from school and give them to their kids.

If the students bring their phones to school they will text their friends, call their friends and take pictures.

In contrast if the students are doing those jobs during classes and there were no school rules the students would play with their phone during class time.

During class time students might listen to their favorite songs on their phone and don't pay attention to the teacher which they will get a worst citizenship in their report card and they will not graduate and they will feel sad and shocked about what they have done to hurt them.

lastly these are the reasons that students allow and not bring their phones to school,",0
"Is almos all the time happiness.                . Went you get the firs impression and is not every day situation is almost all time shame, confusion, uncomfortable, some times pain. Some people think that they can control there first impressions at any time that they wanted to, but thats is not right, first impressions are so fast that it does not let you think, or express in a different way they are faster them a second, there are impressions that can be change, but it depends in the situation that you are in, and other can not be change no matter what you do. I agree with this statement, because impressions are an affect, feeling or image retained after an experience.

Some impressions had a really bat affect in our lives, less say there was a time were maybe the only impression that some had was really not the one he wanted, but was the only one he could do, for example let say that there is a student in a classroom, maybe he is not feeling good, and he fart that it makes a realy loud some, and that everyone in the class hear it, his first impression will be to act normal but he could not act normal, because he knows that it was so loud that everyone heard him, so his going to feel shame of him self, his face is going to get red, and his hears and but thats something you can not control.

The feeling that some get at the firs impression is almost like something you don't have every day, well if you have embarrassing moment every time them you may get the wired feeling every day. Because I had some experience during my life that it make me feel normal now.

I hope that in the future one day, when someone ask me something embarrass, and make me get a moment when my first impression is shame, or embarrass my feeling don't show up, and my experiences take place, for it not to have more affect in the moment, and make it more embarrassing than what it is already, because I dont want it to make me lost my mine, and make the moment the worst one in my life. like went my mom ask me if i had a girlfriend I only smile or answer her that i do not and it is all normal, or at school went my friends ask me if I'm dating the girl I like, the answer I give them is yes or not, like a normal student, I dont get shame or anything. Because it is a very day thing that they ask me things that it makes me uncomfortable.

The experiences that people get went they have a lot of firs impressions, are so impressive that they can act normal in a lot of situation,

for example went they were use to act embarrass or shame now they are capable to act normal, because of the experience that they had. Like I personable had a lot of experience that now insted of feel shame or embarrass I only get happiness. But when is a every day thing, them is almost all the time happynes, like the feeling I get went my family ask me embarrassing questions or we have embarrassing moments. It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change",0
"Most of these stuff you learn in high school, and yes it might be a possibility that you can just learn all of that in three years by doing extra tests maybe staying after school, extra work, and not having any elective classes. In school you just dont learn math or English, for example you also learn:

How to save up money for a better future

How to have a better behavior

You learn how to spell some stuff correctly

How to write essays

There is a lot that you must know before graduating. In my opinion graduating early should not even be allowed because for example i have this one friend that is doing that and taking extra classes, she doesnt have any elective classes, on the weekends she doesnt go out nor spends time with her family, every time i see her instead of seeing her happy i see her stressed and tired, because she works and comes to school but shes most likely graduating this year and that something that you should be proud of, thats something that is going to help you a lot in a future and you can also start saving up money earlier than you thought, but in a future when you look back and remember your high school moments you wont have cute or fun moments to remember all you will remember is ow hard you used to work to get there and how many times you missed maybe a family dinner or a family reunion or a friends sleepover. Basically my option is no, it is not a good idea to graduate early.. Most of the teenagers would love to graduate a year early but doing all that stuff its a lot of stress, maybe instead of enjoying the weekends with your friends or family you just stay home finishing work from school. Some teenagers also have a job after school and doing extra work not spending time with your family nor friends can stress you a lot take a lot of time and yeah it could be worth it but what if you dont pass any of those classes or you do but graduate without even knowing whats the difference between a debit card and a credit card. - Is it a good idea for students to finish high school in three years?

In my opinion it is not a good idea because the normal time to be in school and the normal and traditional years to spend in high school is four years. Graduating early is actually good because you can have a better future but graduating early wont let you enjoy your life right now that we are young. Graduating early is not a bad idea but neither is a good idea, why? because some students need to learn more before graduating. Honestly i thought about graduating early one time and i told one of my friends and all he said was "" If you know you wont regret it in a future go ahead"" that got to my head a lot because this age that we are in now, is only once there wont be no other chance to go back and be 17 years old again, and to enjoy your parents and the time that you have with them right now",0
"They can share and receive help from others they can do work together and when they finish they get free time for their friends.

Thirdly, this is most important because students learn more,they learn the importance of share time with friends,a lot of people have longer friendship because they like to spend time with friends and they do not spend time with a phone. All the kids should do extracurricular activities in school because this can help then in a future,especially if they take importance to improve their grades.

To conclude, every student should do activities after school,this is a benefit for their future and for their learning skills. Parents should be interest in these things because most students have bad grades in their classes and this is an opportunity for improve grades. This can help students to improve their grades,because every activity count as a grade or extra credit.

Firstly,students should do extracurricular activities because this can improve their grades, if they do extra credit after school teachers can replace a missing assignment for the extra credit. Doing sports is an activity that can help kids to be healthy and stronger.. Students can improve their grades in different ways they can do particularly activities like sports, if students do sports they can practice their beneficent for do activities after school. 78% of Americans students do extracurricular activities, by staying after school,doing sports and serving on the student council. One important thing is that students can receive help from others students or teachers,a lot of students stay after school for receive help especially when they have missing assignments,if they do not understand a topic.

Secondly,students can spend time with their friends, this is important because some students spend their time in technological things like phones,video games and things like that ,others students like to stay after school because they can share time,ideas or comments how they are in their grades,by sharing ideas they can help each other in their work,especially if they do not understand something",0
"Is like a in my life I do not have a grat attitude in many things but, everytime I tray to do it and that is a attitude positive because until sometimes I think that I can my pisitive attitude help me to no give up.

My last reason is posittive attitude help you in your job because you can do it everthing with a posittive attitude you can do better your job. acomplish your goals, and help you in your job.

My first reason, is positive attitude help you be a better person with the others. Positive attitude can help to create a better relationship with other people if you really want to get succes in your life you have to take positive attitude in your job school and with the others . If other person is angry you with your positive attitude can make that the other feel great and create a better relationship with others.

My other reason is with posittive attitude you cam acomplish your goals. ""Positive attitude is the key to success in life"" I agree with this because the key to get succes in your life is positive attitude. You can learn many things in your job a get a better position with a better payment.

To summary, possitive attitude is important in our life if you are negative you can not doing anything but if you have a positive attitude you can do wherever you want the positive attitude help you in your job, in the school, and in the relationship with others. Positive attitude is important in our life. Because help you to do a better your work, study, and get better rusults.  .

"They could be telling theemselfs "" i'm going to fail"" or anything else instand of that they sould try telling them say ""i'm going to try to do my best. They should also try to have a good mindset during it.. Their are kids in middle and high school who study and at times get bad grades. Havin a good mindset meaning to think positivly and to know that not having passed their test or anyting in life. Other times kids should learn from their mistakes. They dont know intill they try to do their best.

Having a good mindset can help. They might have or might have not fail and they shouldn't put it on themselfs because they could fail if not.

These are ways to provent kids from having a bad attitude to having a good attitude during their difficult time. Other times kids thing negativly about themselfs and they bring themselfs down. Here are some ways to try to have a good attiude during these times.

Getting a bad grade on a test or quiz. One way to provent this from happen is by having a good mindset. That everyone had to start from one place and build on. They can deepdown be mad, but if they put tell themselfs that ""i'll try harder next time"" they could do better on the retake or on the next quiz or test. They should try to be more calm and the should try to not overreact at much. Some kids overreact by saying ""if i fail this i wont get a job"". These kids have trouble knowing that they failed their test or quiz. Even when some kids that study a lot and fail some of they overreact during it.

Overreacting is another promble kids have. There are a lot of poeple these days that having a bad attiude during a difficult time",0
"For example turning in stuff late that were long due, not all student that attend classes from home take it as an advantage but those who do they just take more advantage just to have fun and not do the work that they are suppose to be doing. Students will spend more time partying, hanging with their friends instead of actually doing the work that they need to do which will actually help them later on. Most students actually know the stuff they just preferred not to do any of the work cause they don't feel like doing it.

Finally, The students actually don't learn nothing by attending classes from home all they do is just party, hang out with their friends and boyfriend. They will spend most of their time doing other stuff instead of the work that they need to be done with. Most student they attend classes from home as an opportunity to have fun and to take a break from school, they literally will learn nothing cause all they do is play around when they are suppose to take things seriously they just want to party all day long and not care about any of the stuff that they are suppose to be studying.

In closing, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they take advantage of it to do other things that they need to do, they don't do what their suppose to do they don't do their work as suppose to do, and they don't learn nothing all they do is party, hang out with their friends and boyfriend they don't do none of the things that they are assign to do. They actually don't do any of the work that they are assign to do they just cheat by copying it off of someone or get the answers from the internet. They take advantage of the time they have to go out with friends to party, to hang out with their boyfriend, and to do other things that are non-school related.

Most importantly, they don't do what their suppose to do, when they get an assignment or project that their suppose to do they just act lazy and not do it cause they know nobody for example, like their teacher wont be telling them to do the work. Another thing is they will always try to come up with an excuse of why they didn't do the assignment that they were suppose to do. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they take advantage of it, they don't do what their suppose to do, and they don't learn nothing.

First of all, student take the advantage of attending classes from home to do other things that they need to do.                                   . Does student really benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Students wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home because I once had a friend who attended classes from home she never did what she was suppose to do she took that as an advantage to do other things that she needed to do she didn't benefit at all",0
"Doing dome work can also help student keep up the grade.

Next, learning more thing can also help you during school day, it can also get you ready for a test or a pop quiz at any time so you don't have to stay up late to study or wake up early int he morning to review. Some teacher give out homework to help the student remember thing that the student learn that day in their head. You can also get ahead of your friend in your class.

Last, every one need some free time after school,but you cant because on the homework that the teacher give you. It help you with your home work, help you learn more, and its also give you more free time. Beginning an after school program can help student gets their homework done fast, learn more thing, and also having more free time.

First, every one need to do their homework from the teacher. When school is over and student try to gets started on their homework, but they don't understand the work and their'er no teacher there to help them with the homework. During school many student struggle with one or more subject in class, but there are teacher at school to help them with their work. After school is a place for every one to have fun wile learning.. Now a student with low grade can bring their grade up and the student that do not know any thing now is at the top of the class. Going to an after school program can help you finish your homework fast and also give you free time at home to take care of your little brother or sister.

After all, after school is a place for every one",0
"What Ralph Emerson say,sometimes it could be a challenge for some adult but it is more then a challenge for teenagers,because since you are a children you know how your life is going to be.

If you grow up in a family who cares about you on what you do the whole day you know that you are lucky because not all people have the same family as you. Most people take that decision when they are teenagers,that is the most hard decision to make because you are living all your past behind and trying to work hard and never go back to the same place.

People who did take that decision when they where young they know how it feels be on that situation, they learn how to be themself and how a real man act. So to be yourself you have to be strong mind. At this point this teenagers has to decide to be himself a man of good and make proud his family and show them what you did with out their help or end up in jail. When the person don't have support from their family they do what they can so they can have some money on their pockets and have some food on the table for their family. That is what be yourself mean care about you and your family and give to your little brothes the opportunities that you did not have. When a teenager have a family who do not care about him he is going to end up having more problems them that one who have a good family. This world is for the people with strongest feeling weak people don't survive in this world.

"career can show how creative students can be, and have a had start to choose their careers before they get out of high school.

First, I would like to talk about how creative students can be in their career. for example, if I where to choose a career I would have to tell my teachers what classes that I what to take for my career chooses it can help a lot of students with their career chooses it would be a problem for them to tell the teachers what careers they want and it would be more easier for them to start telling the teachers what career they want and put students in the class they want to take for their career but they have to trust their teachers first then they can tell the students what careers that they what to take or what good classes are good for this career that the student chooses and that's my opinion on students should be commit to a career at a young age.

Thank you for taking the time to read through my thoughts about career chooses that means so much to me and thank you again.

Sincerely,

Generic_Name      . For example, I would like to express myself through my art to show my emotions and I love to excess myself through my art. It makes me feel happy but if I don't start choosing my career at a young age then how am I going to know what I want for my career and the students won't know what they want for their career when they get out of high school and that's how I would like to express myself through my career.

Also, about students having a head start to choose their career at a young age. Dear, Dr. Generic_Name

Thank you for reading my letter. I am currently a junior at Generic_School. I hope it finds you well. I believe that the students should commit to career at a young age because. for example, I would not know what to choose if I didn't start in high school it would be a waste of time for me to find a career if I didn't start at a young age, if I started at school then there won't be a problem for me to find one also I would rather start now then later on in my life and how Am I going to express myself if I don't have a career to start with thats why students should think a head of choose their career.

Last, students should think about what they want to do or be when they grow up because schools can help with your career when you need it, they can put you in a class where you want to learn about the career that you choose and it will make is so much easier for the student to start now.

"Also, Teachers agree that would be a good upgrade for the students to have a extra meal that is healthier and it is in a good quantity. Otherwise, Students that come to our school since freshman year love the tradional food of the cafeteria.

It is a good idea to include the new recipe of food in the cafteria menu because, it will have more types of vitamins, proteins, and all type of good suppliments that a young healthi body needs. The idea of creating a new menu for the cafeteria affects people who are trying to have a healthier diet, and kids who need to be clean of bad supplements for the sports season. If the changing in our menu happens, the students that do sports will have a second meal to support all the exercise that is needed for the soccer teams, football, etc...

In some others opinion, the new menu in the cafeteria will affect the businness in our school, beacuse the students that are in the school for a longer time will not like to change their favorite types of food.

Some students might not agree with the changing of the recipe in the cafeteria, but for those reasons, the principal and teachers agree that the new menu would be a healthier and more elaborated meal for everyone in our school.",0
"I think that you should let us bring our phones to school cause what if there is a emergency at our house or with our families and we don't know about it or our parents need to tell us that we cant stay after school because we have to go pick up our little brother or sister. then people would want to come to this school because we could bring our phones to school . I also think u should let u bring our phones to school cause it would make the school better. then u could use it as a punishment instead of having to think of something else you could just say you cant use you're phone for 2 weeks.      . these are some of the reasons that think you should let us bring our phone to school hopefully you

"so if you or any one else is bored than try doing soccer for you can not be that bored anymore so just be playful a and play right for you can not be that bored at anything anymore so just try it one day and i highly recommend you that you will like playing soccer

But like i tell you if you are that lazy that you can't even do anything then you have to try one thing. My enjoyable educational activity is P.E

P.e is my favorite educational activity because i mostly enjoy it. But the other thing is that when we are at p. And i would enjoy it because soccer is my family favorite thing to do when we are bored and its nice outside we would play like two hours and before we play soccer we would have steak and enjoy the temperature. Because you have to try something because you can't live a life that you can't even do anything you have to at least try to do something in your life so yeah thats all i have to tell you so play something right not bad. e is boring but i think that it is fun because thats when most of the time i play with my friends and i would enjoy it mostly because thats like the only time we would be free a and out of school work and play with my friends. e because its enjoyable to do it to not the test but the activity's they have.

And soccer to they have lots of training to do but the rule is to have fun and play nice for you can enjoy the people and the coach. e people don't like it because some of them are tired and some of them are just bored at p. The most thing i do in that class is play basketball which i am trash at it but i still play with the boys and i enjoy the time .Another thing i like to do is soccer because its playful and playing with friends is more better. Because all my friends are in that class. So i don't know what people say about it but i enjoy p. Because it helps you with teamwork,speed and skill.

Soccer is my favorite sport because when I was little I would always see all the games. e. And after the steak we would play soccer with my uncle and some of my dad's friends and we would play soccer until we would get very tired.

So back to p. e some people think that p. e i don't really get it but they just think that it is so boring or their tired of doing anything.

P.e and soccer are technaclily the same thing because they could run around and they could enjoy their time with some friends but like i tell you that there's people that doesn't like doing p. Just try to play soccer don't be that lazy and do it.",0
"for example it can be stealing or drugs if you are dong those things you will be success but is not a right choice for you and you keep doing it one day you will have to pay for what you did, most people prefer to work hard every day to be able to have at least everything, I prefer people to do the right thing because doing bad is not going to get you anywhere you might be success but it wont be forever id rather work hard so i can be success in life . now doing bad things is not right because you can be success for a while. now some people with a bad attitude are success they dont even have to try to work hard to be success.

Image how many people work hard and hard every day just be success in life, but theres a couple of people that have a positive attitude and they are success in life basically living life great, there are people people that dont have a positive attitude they just do bad things to be success. I disagree with the statement about a positive attitude is the key to success in life because there's others things you need to be success in life anyone can have a positive attitude and they are not success or probably won't be, theres only few percent of people in this world that are success there are some people that dont have a positive attitude and they are success in life.

For example people with a positive attitude they try so hard to be success in life but they cant they keep trying, trying and nothing happens",0
"Students my also need to save up for a higher education if they plane on attending a 4 year university or even attending a community college.     . Students may have or need a job for many such ass, being able to sport there family so they are not always going to be available after school to attend those classes required to graduate in 3 years. Some students take advance courses that are more chalaging, and give out more homework then regular classes. some students are not going to be available after school because they may have to stay after school to retake important quizzes or test that are going to affect a big part of there grade. another reason is that they might be involved in clubs so they also have to stay after school and also have to do some type of volunteering in the community so thats going to take away time so they may not be away available to attend to all the required classes to be able to graduate using the 3 year program. Another reason why students should not be allowed to do the 3 year program is because its going to be stressful trying to put a 4 year education in 3 years. Students should not be alowd to graduate with the three year program because the student my have a job, focus on there academics, be involved in a extra curricular activities after scholl. One other major reason is that the student with be involved in extra curricular activity such ass sports some sports can be year around sports so even is not there season they still have to condition and train for the upcoming season so they are most likely going to have to stay after school hours to do those things. another reason is that they might have tutoring either at home or in school so they are able to get help on homework and other material that they need help with projects and stuff like that.

My conclusion is that no students should not be alowd to graduate early using the 3 year program, became is going to add on to things that the students already have going on in there lives so i believe student should just graduate with there class and take there time and graduate high school in 4 years. A student may have to go home and work on big projects or homework so there ability to stay after school is going to be limited due to the fact that they have homework to do and other assignment. students also need some time of work expires so they need that job so they are able to put on there resume that they have some form of work expires so if they decide that right after high school they want to just jump in into the work force they have some type of work expires",0
"When making work with a group other explain what are doing, what the teacher explain in the class what type of work make or project.

Working with a group all students feels more benefits for take the good grade for the make all together the nice job: However working in group is try the express the best idea in the group try help other, and one give the best example or make change the students in the group have the best grade to coming up someone students don't turn in the work this is affect the grades this is time to the change the grades for all sustain as making or learn more about what the teacher explain in the class for every vary pass the class. I think my preference is working with a group have more benefits with the working alone with myself. Because working with a group is more better have more ideas about of projects, every vary collaborate with the work making all together not distracting with the other students, and all in the group help with the ideas, what work need for the project, what talk about in the work, or what type of project made, what are doing the teacher said with the work.

Need stand enfouces all in the group for making the best work together, and make the nice grade for the group some students in the group don't have the perfect score but is the opportunity for the make change of the grades and working with a group, and someone not sustain what are you do try to the express the ideas and collaborate with all the group and working in one thing, what talk about in the project or the work in the class or need help can to help to what type of expression need more learn in the working with a group.

Sometimes working with a group all have ideas, what are doing first, who make the tittle of the work , of who have the perfect idea of present ate the work or explain with the group what is the best are doing in talk about of the work and projects.         . Because when take one best decision some students said i like this idea or the others.

Some students like work with other students or not someone is quit not like express the idea or like only with self for example; Working with a group is more benefits work you can express your ideas for make the best work in the class or more best in the other students group some many student when make working alone sometimes catch good score or bad this students don't put penitencion in the class or distracting with cellphone or other things. when some students working alone is more complicate for sustain with take the best idea sometimes don't likes what are doing with the work.

"The idea of planning for a career is to perpar yourself and other for the future, career planning is to perpar yourself and other for a colleges that is specific to the career of what your looking for specific, and help plans for the career job that you or others had work for in the past.

Students that enters high school should start looking for the their career, becaue it keeps the student commit to the career, and keeps the students focas toward their future careers. If a student start seaching for his or her career can focas more on their career to find the specific college and the job that they study for their career.

"After a long time taking bad decisions, he finally decided to make things better for the people who cares about him and specially for him. For example, one day you are going to the basement of your house which is really big and put some good music. For instance, when you are trying to get a girl that you met in a party but you have no idea of what to do in order to get her attention. He tells you what to do exactly and shows you with some women at the party and now you have some ideas of what you can do. And one of the most important things, you could make a good influence in someone else's life and teach him/her how to find their path in their own way. After dancing for a long while, suddenly you let the music take control over you and you make a back flip without practicing it before. This means you will do whatever is right in order to become a better person. While you are listening to your favorite songs from your playlist, you are dancing according to the tempo and doing the dancing moves that you usually do. It took him over 5 years for him to get back on his feet; with his own effort and the support from his family and friends, he started to make a good difference for the world. He even went to court for all the messy things he did. Also, you are acknowledging different methods about how to be better than yourself. After following those examples in your own way, the girl started to have deep feelings for you and everything worked out a lot well and make some influence to some of your friends who need that kind of help. That way you are definitely writing your own script but at the same time, giving the deserved credit to the person who gave you those tips. You are very surprised because you did something that you did not know you could do and after that, you keep practicing that move and perfectioning it and it comes out natural. When it comes to trying to be someone, is it better to improvise or follow the script all the time?

Everyone needs to have their own individuality and be original instead of trying to be something else because that way you learn more about yourself. That is how you learn more about yourself.

You are acknowledging different methods to be better than yourself. Right now, Robert is one the best actors in Hollywood, he has an excellent life with his wife and kids on his side, and is a great influence for millions of people. You make a good influence by doing things as right as possible and you give people some benefits out of it. So before you reach out to that girl, your friend tells you ""be yourself all the time"" and you get the courage to talk to her. That is how you acknowledge different methods to be better that yourself.

Some people say that you are copying someone else when you try to be yourself. You acknowledge new ways to become better than yourself like if you were in a videogame, you are going to the next level slowly. No matter what happens, you always have to follow yourself.

When you learn more about yourself it means that you do not just learn things that you already know about yourself, you also learn new things that you did not know about yourself. To be yourself you have to do what your gut tells you to do if you think it is going to give some benefits in some way.. However, they are wrong because you actually are listening to those tips that you have heard and following them under your own perspective. You ask your friend for some advice to accomplish your goal so you do not go through a bad experience. That is how you follow your own script with your own terms.

In conclusion, it is very important that you have be yourself all the time because it shows that you do not need somebody in order to be somebody. For example, Robert Downey Jr used to have a terrible life by consuming drugs and other things that got him in trouble with the law. You learn about yourself so you can get to know your own person more than you can know about an anime character",0
"In the futures lets hope this world and the people and objects in it will change in a postive way so our first impressions can be possible to change. Why? Because nothing changes everything it remains if something does change ,it changes in negative way. First impressions can change by getting more involved and finding more information about that subject but, it is impossible to change that. Do you think first impressions are impossible to change? Some people say that first impressions are possible to change by getting more in detail. Or a type of food that looks strange to you, you automatically start saying negative things about it.

Also, peoples thoughts never seem to really change you will always see that character or thing the same way.        . I agree that first impression are impossible to change because first impressions are negative and peoples thoughts don't change.

In other words, first impressions are usually negative. As an example, people get more cruel or companies start inventing products that shouldn't be together. Things should be possible to achieve not impossible. For example, if you see a person and he or she just has a serious face, your first impression ""that person has bad vibes''. Your mind won't change unless that person ,place or thing changes in a positive way.

So, first impressions are almost impossible to change",0
"Some people when lose something material and they don't care the material things, they looking for a solution,

Second,

if you get a problem in your workplace, you would like to resolve the problem. Some people when have a problem in her workplace want to resolve the problem because they are passive

Third, if you discuss about something to someone and the person is losing the control of ennoyance, you won't response back because you don't want more problems. Some people when someone is losing the control of her ennoyance and want to fight, they don't do anything because they are passive.

However, I know sometimes it is difficult something it doesn't affect ourself because sometimes it relate to family, or somenthing is really matter for us.

In conclusion, we choose our own character traits because we can choose if something affect ourself.. We choose our own character traits becouse we can choose if something affect ourself for three reasons:

First, if somenthing is doesn't matter for you, it will doesn't affect you",0
"Now i really want to go to portorico and explore new stuff and have a nice adventure.. I also want to see how teachers are with their students when they get in trouble because i want to see if they are different than El Salvador cause there they hit their students with the ruler and that is not okay.

In conclution I would like to see every difference they have from the USA and El Salvador and i want to try every food that they have and spend time with students. I want to be greatful of everything that i am able to have and they dont and maybe share the stuff that i have and they dont. One place i would like to go visit in this world would be portorico because it looks like a wonderful place to live in and because i want to experince how it is to live there or how school is for them. It might be a life changing for me to see how they live there maybe i might start being greatful for what i have and they dont and i would start helping others mor often.

One reason i would go to portorico is to see how they do stuff different like what they wear,what they eat, and what they do on daly it would be intersting seeing all that and i would like to try new food and wear the cloths they wear and try to see how it feels to be a portorican.

Another reason i would love to go to portorico is because at the USA i am not greatful for what i have and maybe if if i go over to portorico i will be greatful for what i have because i will see the difference of how i live and how they live it will also melt my heart to see them eating unhealth and i am over here throwing my food away because i dont want it.

My final reason for wanting to go to portorico is because i will want to see how their parents are with the kids like when they get in trouble",0
"Another benefit of being home school is that you dont have to wake up early in the morning to go to school, you don't have to miss the bus anymore, don't have to worry about sports, staying after school, basically you have freedom to do more stuff, a lot of people in high school dont have time to go out or have som fun, not many kids are able to go out becasues their parents are strict and dont let them out but that's besides the point, many kids take avantange of home school some of those kids, they have parents that travel around the world and they dont have a chance to sit down and talk about what is going on in school or the everyday life, their parents will take their kids with them becasue they dont want their kids to be home alone, instead they take the kids with thme so they don't have to miis out on their aventues, and a lot of these kids are very talented and ready for the out side world becasue their education was high quiality and always on point. For example I have friends that do school at home and they are just like regular kids from High School, a lot of people would say that being home school its like going to prison but it's not, home school just gives us a better way of learning at home with no one to bother. That's all I have to say.. Yes, I do agree, because it's a great way of learning because we don't have to deal with other kids in school, we're save because we are home, we don't have to worry about going out to the dangerous world that we in now. They are good kids and bad kids that do home school, some of them coud have got in a ot of trouble and its not able to go back to school and some kids are home school because their patrenst have to work out of the country and they can be home by their selfs and they take thier kids with the. Another benefit of being home school is that you never have to worry about school shooters bad people in school, getting abues in school, not dealing with any problems with other students",0
"You could have done something that you had to do. Sometime you have to force yourselfe to work, and in life you need to keep moving on, in what you're doing, you have to make sure that you never go back in the past, because you would like to realize your dream that you promised yourself in the future.

For this position you may say that if you are trying to do something, and you already know that it is not going to be right, just leave it until you find the right way to do it. If you already have a plan to do something you need to think about it, before you start doing it. People who does not have patient cannot make an experience without helping from someone else, and a project is not hard to make, but you have to think about what you are going to say in the project.

There are a lot of way you should find to do something, and even if you would not undertand what you are doing. Now you will be growing up, and people will appreciate you everywhere you go to. If you have an experience to do something, and prove it you need to think about it first, before you try your best in what you were trying to do. You will grow in a good situation, if you are always doing good things and you never do something wrong. Don't give up, because one day you will realize your dream. You have to check it, so to make sure it is good or not good, so that is the way you can learn from your mistakes.

Most of the time, you feel like you cannot do anything all you can do is just sleeping that does not mean you will never grow. For this subject I do not agree with it, because if you're making mistake often that doesn't mean you will never grow up. For example you have already done some stuff that you are not supposed to do, life is going on that does not mean you will never grow. In life, you suppose to have done the right things to continue with the others.",0
"It would help their future. Another way that it helps the students being patient is that they also sometimes might have to redraw it if the drawing does not come out as good as they thought it would, and that requires patience, especially if make a mistake when you are about to finish it. Art would help them in life and school. Being creative would help them in several ways.

And lastly, art would help them be focused. When you are drawing you have to focus on what you are doing. And also, they woul need to focus in the directions when doing their work.

In conclusion, art would be helpful in several ways, It would help them to be a patient, creative, and focused person. For example, if the student dream about their future, then it would help them to think more and be creative about what they want to do. Being a more focused person would also help them in life. This is why I would like to share this lesson with them.. And also, when they are working in groups they might have to explain for the rest of the group what are their ideas and how they want to do the project, which also requires patience.

The second way art would be important to students is by making them more creative. When you are making art you have to be creative and think a lot. You have to be patient when you are making realistic drawings, because if you draw fast you might forget to add important details and the drawing may not come out as good as it would if you had drawn it with patience. If you lose the smallest bit of focus, you can make a mistake and might have to do everything again. Being creative wouldn't only help them at school, it would also help their future. Art is the lesson that I would like to share with elementary school students because it could help them in several different ways.

The first way art would help the students is by making them more patient. When you are doing art and using paints, sometimes you have to wait until it dries so you can add more details and etc, that is one way that art can help them be more patient. When I was in elementary school, I've always wanted to have art lessons",0
"For example, responsibility, respect, and more manners. Also more people have the requisite by working; although needing experience but can learned. The reality is which work help me for my future,and giving more experience. Many people look for a job without have experience for a better life, and learning new stuff. The people want learning about the job for more experience, and a better future.

In conclusion, many people need a opportunities, and show off the potential. Anyhow, the employee doing a hard-working, and the employers be glad. To be a good employee help always for letter of recommend about your ability. The manners is very important in your potential, and your characteristics is important too, because the employers evaluate this.

Some may say, which people's do not have experience can not working, because thinking this persons have a bad conduct. . Most employers are looking for specific characteristics in a potential employee. When the employers misjudge a people's because not have experience this remove the opportunities; but the reality is everyone learning, and have the privilege of working. The employers look for people's responsible, and make a good job. In lots places taking decision for giving job for people's do not have experience.

First, most of people do not have to study by cause not working, by do not have experience, and do not can pay the study. The employers can giving news opportunities of working for people's have a better life, and future. I'am a good candidate for working, because I have manners and learning fast. When the employee doing a hard-working is for news opportunities.

Second, nevertheless when you are responsible may-be your employers giving a raise. Most employers think which the employee do not following the rules, and doing a bad job. A job can teach the people's a lot things. Most time the employee do not have experience, and many time the employers look those. In fact all word need the opportunities for working, and general a good future",0
"The situation to think really good if you dont due you can not think what it's gonna happen.

because if you only imagine you don't gonna knowledge good because, if you only imajinate and say the words after you knowledge the words you what to says. and if you knowledge first after think you can be able to due son tings.

If you gonna to due a story if you only imagine you can not be able to due because you have to Knowles the situation first after you think because son times you can get good imagination and you have to knowledge.

like for example if don't knowledge you don't gonna now were put tings to knowledge the situation were you gonna put things and the ca n be better.

I don't no what scientists Albert Einstein think and i gonna now what he thinks because, people have different opinion like how it's more better to they can use, and because persons have different ideas,like me i think then knowledge it's more important, then imagination but others people they can think it'snot because for people to see things it's different, because if the person am gonna write the story am gonna use the knowledge to knowledge, the situation better and make good story.

The knowledge it's like then a group because you have to search or knowledge to now what you gonna due because, if you only have in a imagination to what you gonna due that can work, like when you go to your job and you have to knowledge,what you gonna due for the day.

when you go to school and you go to science if you have to examine the a plant you have to knowledge the plant to now were you can star to examine the plant.

when you due sometimes you have to knowledge the situation,like for example,when a person quilled to another person, the police they have to knowledge,the scene and who was the criminal and knowledge the situation how died and who was .

some people think the imagination it's was first and it's more important would, I think the people see for different forms to due would a think some people it's right because, I see for different forms like when you imajinate it's like when you imajinate the things would you can have a picture in your minds like you can see pictures like were you what to put things.

but you can have im imajine in your mied but you have to knowledge first because i think if you knowleged because i feel more necesary to knowleged beause when you knowledged you can feel it's more easy or if you look like the pictures way it's more easy, because you see the things more specific en your miend.

it's alot ways to you can see things because for people some people looks diferets to others you can see more better in you way if you don't get.

i think people it's look things different ways and other they look like the same but the most important it's the way you see the tings for you.. Scientist Albert Eisnste sad "" imagination is more important than knowledge "" I disagree with the statement.

I disagree imagination is more important that knowledge.

I disagree because, I think knowledge it's more important because, you have to knowledge after you imagine because, I think knowledge it'a more important because you have to knowledge",0
"As life goes on do I think its going to help me improve what Im doing right now or is it going to drop me and destroy me for life. Why is it better asking someone about the decision is because they could tell you either the desicison is good or they could tell you that don't do it and try to find a better idea. Thats why you should ask someone else who is already doing that particular thing from before or ask someone who could give you an personal opinion/advice that would actually make you think if making this life decision is worth it or not.

When buying something big that will have a effect on my life i would have think about my budget and how am I going to afford this project without having any issues. They probably think better than me or in some way where we both agree on the same fact to achieve the business or investment in a better way. To achieve my business i would have to ask someone for a advice who is already doing something similar to that. When asking others for advice I would have to think about how they're going to respond and what they're going to say. This is why budget is also a very big thing when it comes to making life decisions is because I would have to pay that amount in order to have my business or investment stand out out the people around me.

Why would I have to ask someone to achieve my investment or business. Its because someone else has a different mind set than you yourself. When making a life decision you have to think about the importance, how much it would cost me or whats the overall budget, and how its going to help me achieve in life.

When making life decisions it really matters on how its important to you or how its going to effect you in life. So the mains things you need is how important the investment or business is to me, How high or low my budget is, and what will I have to do to achieve this business/investment. They'll give me the best advice or opinion even how big or little the investment/business is.. As Im asking for the opinion or the advice i would have to think how or what Im going to do to improve that decision. So to do that I would ask someone for advice who is already doing that business or investment. Thats why when making a life decision you should think about what things and what mind set you need to proceed with your investment or business. For all these reasons you should always ask a person about their advice or opinion even though I might not listen to it but it doesn't hurt to ask. Why would I ask others for advice when I have brain and thats because they're going to have a different mind set from me. When making life decisions it also depends on how you're looking at that particular thing/object. What hard work or thinking of mine or someone else's would have to go in that play to achieve the decision. When making life decisions it is good to ask someone for help then making the desicison yourself. This is why you should ask someone else for a advice or a opinion than going in alone in such a big decision that could impact your life in less than some days.

In conclusion to making life decisions it is a good idea to ask someone else for a advice than making the move alone. As I would be achieving the decision I would have to see how Im being affected with it and how much pressure its putting on me",0
"Last example, that the older student and the young student can help each other out to come up with an ideas so other student can help out to try and make the a bigger program. For example, the young students could get some advice from the older ones because they ready took the program or the Sol before so can help them understand what their are trying to do. Some schools have a program that older student and the young ones that could help one another. Another example,the older student be in the program to help a younger to try and make something easy to him.. For example, if they don't understand they could ask one of the student to get help of understanding. Another example, would be that the older ones can learn new things from the young student to see what is different from the past and preisant. Some school do not have program but they should so others student can get to now each other and even have ideas that can help others.

Secondly, student form lower grade to higher grade level should be a in the program to learn stuff new",0
"That can be a bad idea to choose a career at a young age because you can choose a career you know nothing about, which means once you learn the job you might not even like it as much as when you first chose it. Committing to a job at a Young age is bad and good idea, why you may ask? Well at a young age you might have a fantacy and a very huge immagination well at least i did, as a kid this could help because if you commit to a career at young age. Now i know i want to travel the world and be a Photographer and learned to speak up for myself and it helped me to communicate with my dad and be straight forward with him there for kids are confused at a young age.

Reasons why commiting to a career at a young age is a good idea.  . It'll make the job easier, funnier and more comftorable.

""In some societies, students are expectected to identify a career by the time they enter high school."" Personally i think Choosing a career at a young age is a bad idea, because like i said it is a proven fact that your brain isn't fully developed at a young age. May aslo be a bad idea because when you get older you learn to hate things you enjoyed as a kid and it would just leave you with a career you cant enjoy as much as you use too. There for you wouldn't be worried and freaking out about what career you are going to do after school you would already be prepared mentally and physically.

As a kid you enjoy whatever your parents are doing, so you would obviously choose a career to be with your parents and thats a good thing as a kid. For example when i was a kid i enjoyed to play Football i always thought i would do it until i died. Your brain also isn't fully developed until you're older it is a proven fact.

Having a fantacy and a very great immagination is good because it can motivate you to choose a good carreer which you would obviosly enjoy in the future. This can also be a terrible idea because at that a young age you don't really know what you want as a career, you just go with what ever your parents or the person you look up to does and as you get older you relize you were not really into that career. When kids are young they like what others like its just how society makes you think, as you get older you become wiser and realize thats not what you actually want to do. As i got older i began to hate it, because it wasn't really what i wanted to do it was what my dad wanted me to do which i enjoyed because it made him happy. When you're older you'll be an expert and know the job by memory. Having to commit to a career at a young age can save you time in the future, when you have graduated you would automatically have a option and know what job you are going to do. There for you should not choose a career when you are in high school and just enjoy your school year's once you graduate you'll regret it and wish you had just relaxed but that does not mean you should'nt plan for upcoming careers you should have more than one option, prepared for after you graduate. The more you get older the more you know about the job so you'll be a wealthy man getting paid good by the time you are twenty five. For example let's say Your father could be working as a construction worker and because he does it you might chose your career to be a construction worker",0
"I'm going to take position on myself to spoken in this introduction, things did i most enjoy in high school is having the opportunity to study here in the United State. one of the things did I'm thinking about what I going to do after school is going directly at collage don't lust the time did I win. And also learn a new language I'm so thanks full for all those opportunities.

All of the things did happen on my life was not easy, and also I remember when my cousin speak English like a normal language and he also came from where came from and i remember did i said i want to spoke like you i was so impressed and how he can speak English like a normal person here in the U.S, because in that time I did not any English at all. When was my time to get in high school begin all this things did i was want for a long time. In high school to ca be graduate and learn how the new life is in here, and learn a lot of things to adapted or to fit to the new language and the new people what did I say new here is another world, new people new language that is why I'm here, I came from to my native country. first day I was so nerviest but at the same time exerted because I came in with my mind in what I'm want and what I love was and is learn English and spoke like normal.

Generic_School give the opportunity at the students graduate on three years, except at the normal traditional four, let me tell you why I take three years except at the normal four cause my age I'm almost getting on (21) at the date to graduate for example, if I'm taking the four years of high school when the people have more then 21, they kicking you off the school

I thing was I good idea taking just the three years to can be graduate on time.

In addition all what has to happen to can be graduate is taking all of the classes did I need it to get the credits. Was the perfect idea graduate in three years that helps me in everything I'm agree wit that program and idea of the district. making or taking classes on summer school maybe night school to graduate on time is hard process to graduate in three year but helps a lot to the people who work after school or another thing that probably they has to do, to graduate without credits missing.

"its when we are learning to be focus and making sure next time to be success and whatever we did wrong.

In fact, sometimes it's hard to when we have had failures a fewers times, because we do not want to commit mistakes, but i think that is a beneficial for most of the people. As a matter of fact,

when we are setting goals to our life's and we can't get that goal it's because we are doing something wrong and we don't even realize what's wrong with it. Because the most mistakes we have and at the same time we overcome to have more experience in life. second of all, my suggestions are that to be a positive person, and determinate, smart, and wise person it make us a better person in success.

In conclusion, some people believes that having failures is how we are success in life and others don't think that way. Actually, when people cling to themselves isn't good for their goals in lifes.

However, I believe that making failures is how we move on to succe ss in life and is more beneficial to our life's. Also I believe that fixing problems is a good way to be success in life. Othes believes that is if we are determinated person and having positives thoughts without limitations. Actually, successing in life with failures is more baneficial to our life's, because we learn how to believes on us, and we may have a life without doubts.

As a result, if we are the kind of person who doesn't makes any mistakes and realizing to success. Some others people realized right before they are committing the mistake and they are just avoiding them. Sometimes most of the people have goals to achieve in their life's. i think that we wouldn't know what are we doing wrong to be determinated person. Some people believes that making mistakes is how peoples move on to success. I think that those are my thoughts to be a better person in successful. Although some say, successing in life without failures, our lifes wouldn't make sense, because we would not learn how to be success in our life's. However i do believe so that to be a success person, we have to fail a fewers times, because it's really important to me to be a determinate person. Otherwise i can tell the 80% of the people belives that making failures is how we learn to success and we become a civilized person. and by the way, I'm totally agree that we have to fail first to be a success person.. Also most of the people wouldn't have knowlwdge to succes in their lifes. First of all, when we fix what we did wrong",0
"Leaning and teaching face to face is always easier than online. So in the bottom line. Nobody wants to get up early and go to school or work when the sun hasn't even risen and frezzing weather outside. But winter is the worst time of the year for students. That goes on days after days. They can stay home and attend classes online. The sun rises later than usually and sets earlier. Sometimes they might want to work more, but school is 5 days a week, they have to do homework every night even on weekends. That might a good idea for some students but not all. Plus, you can meet new friends, socialize and participate in sports or any activities at school. You could ask the teachers directly if you don't understand, and I think the teachers would be teaching and explaining in a better way face to face. They work part time to help their parents pay for their phone bills, cars or something else. That might not be a big problem in summer or spring. Cut the students some slack on some Fridays. Staying at home and study is still better than waking up and getting ready early in the morning to go to school. What matters is that the students find their best ways to learn and relieve stress. Today, many High Schoolers from the age of 15 to 18 have jobs. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.          . I think it's better to combine both ways. They get out at 9 or 10 depends on where they work, go home and do their homework, then go to bed probably late, and have to get up early the next morning. Of course they want to wrap around in their blankets and sleep in. The students can attend school everyday, except for snow days. Or only apply on seniors. Attending clases online or directly at school don't matter. But in the other hand, attending to school directly is better for some students. Because it's their last year and they have lots of work to do. So I think attending classes online or video conferencing help lots of students who have jobs. Many students can get stressed out easily. They can take classes online since they can't make it to school. It gets really cold and there is frozen ice on streets. But in my opinion. Going to work after school is very overwhelming",0
"Mr Ralph waldo Emrson, is traing to explain to us what is good to make. It is really good when you are thinking and just thinking tomaking somting new thing then you will be product for your future. Should the aouthor Ralph Waldo Emerson, is righ what he was wrote.?

If you already learn something new and you want to tray again make sure to try and make little of different because is not really good idea alway making the same thing in your life.

Alway keeping ahead and don't look back to the passed. whatever you just got leaned don't mean that you only have to wrote only that. when you can lean show and making new thing . I agree what Mr. We getting to remember makin a new thing is alway important. Acording to Mr, ralph Waldo Emerson wrote . You will never grow up if you try to making only the sme thing beyond that you just got ready leaned. Ralph Waldo Emerson just said. whatever you already learned don't have to reapead again and again only that.

Because you is not learning new thing you will not get progreesiible for you future when you going grow up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           . If you already was mastered don't has to go at the passed and only wrote alway the same thing in your present.

In conclution, It is important keeping at from and don't only try to make something beyend that you already get done .Is good use what you having ready learned, but you should go and trying new thing. If you already was mastered we can not just put only that when we can learn something new in our life.

First of all,it is important to remember what you already learn, but is not just alway traing to make only the same thing that you ready was mastered belond and yu want to make againg. Also you will get to open your brain assun u look and go ahead.

Secondly, I am disagree to try the same thing that you already get learned in the passed in your life",0
"I have friend his name is Generic_Name and I want to tell you something about him he is the most irresponsible student I have ever seen, but when it comes to a group work he is getting his job always done because he doesn't want his group lose the competition or simply fail the project. In my computer science class we usually work with groups so there is this guy that thinks he knows more than some of us and for that reason he didn't work with us, so we solved the problem the way that no one in our class has solved the problem this way and the teacher gave us extra points for being the creative group of the class, and the smart guy that I mentioned before couldn't solve that problem. This is way I don't like to underestimate my teammates or classmates I know that together we can be smarter, faster, and even

If the problem seems unsolvable together we can do it.

In conclusion, working with a group is enjoyable, make you fulfill your obligations, and makes it easy for students to solve any kind of tasks. For example, I have a friend who didn't like to work with anyone or even talk in his classroom,,, one day his teacher put him with group of students after working with them he finally made a new friends and the work that teacher was giving them was much more enjoyable with mates. For that reason I think this is a great way of learning, communicating and building friendship with people around us.

Also group work makes us more responsible. The benefits of working in the group or working alone. This made my vision clear that working with others makes people more responsible.

Some say working with a group distracts them from the task, but I will disagree with them because I believe, that working in the group helps you find the creative way of solving the problems. When I was in the fifth grader I went to the camp over summer the first day they made us do a project with a group to earn the title of the best group. Finally, students are not going to be stressed about the problem and will complete the task with higher quality.. Working in the group is more beneficial rather than working alone to work in the group is fun, makes me be more responsible and it is also the easier and creative way of finding solutions for the problem.

First of all, working in the group is fun",0
"I believe that self-esteem comes from achievement because the more a student work hard, the more achievements he/she get so when they receive more awards and/or achievements, it makes them to proud of their selves and build true self-esteem.

There are so much students who works hard, complete their work on time and also have a part time job after school, but they don't know how to build their true self-esteem so what they need to work is that they must be self confident because they can't build their self-esteem unless they're self confident.

Also, there are much more students who go to school and don't have a job or anything after school or during weekend and they're self confident, but don't know how to build their self-esteem.

So, students should try their best to receive achievements because it encourages and/or makes them to build their self-esteem.

Self-esteem is something that students can build it by theirsleves if they work hard, be punctual at school and have a checklist or a plan for what they should do first as a calender.

Students aren't working hard nowadays I have no idea that it's because technology makes them lazy or they don't want to plus they're not trying to achieve something at school.

I'm sick and tired of seeing these kind of students because if they just open their school backpack and at least study for two hours at home, they will receive a lot of achievements at school so that's how they can achieve their goals.

So, when it comes to build their true self-esteem, they need to work on achievements and become self confident first and then best version of their selves.

Teachers also have a role in this issue because I think students spend more time with their teacher compare to their parents in a week.

I don't mean teachers discuss with them to build either their self-esteem or self confidence unless the student is smart and curious to ask his/her teachers and peers about becoming like a person who has self confidence and already built his/her self-esteem.

But, at least they show students the right way to get achievements or achieve their goals so that would be enough, and students will start thinking about how to get achievements and then they'll probably start working on their self confidence and self-esteem.

In addition, when I came to the united states it was 2017, I didn't know any English and I didn't have any friends at school so everybody knows how hard it is to go to school and can not speak with anyone or don't have friends plus I was a shy guy.

When somebody was trying to talk to me, my face was becoming red and start blushing so it's all because I didn't have self confidence.

So, I am still trying my very best to learn the language and make some friends at school so I can play or do my work with them together.

That being said, now I can speak, write and read very well and I became so much more confidence, best version of myself, have a lot of friends, and so happy to attend school.

Overall, being self confident and working hard for achievements are like a key for building students self-esteem which comes from achievements.

Students should focus at school or wherever else they study so they get achievements which helps them to build their self-esteem.

Students also should be encouraged by their parents to build their self-esteem as well as by their selves unless they're self confident in life.                                                                            ",0
"It helped me came along this far where I didn't need it anymore. Students can do something else later instead of homework, and it helps them avoid of getting a late work. I made my first friend in 5th grade and his name was Etka, we were both at the program but he knew a lot more English than me so he also helped me improve my communication skills along the way.

I think that after school homework clubs are good for students because students can finish it early with the help of one another and the teacher. Students can help the ones that are having a difficult time of doing their homework, they can also finish their work easily. I was scared to talk to people because I thought that they would make fun of me because I didn't know how to talk, but I was wrong. The most important thing about this club is that it improves your learning skills and your communication skills.. For example, when I stayed after school for my English teacher to do work, I realized that I finished most of my work because I was focused and I asked the teacher multiple times to help me with some of the work. Homework clubs are good for students because they can finish it early, they can help each other, and it improves their learning skills.

First, students finish early. It improves their collaboration, and it improves their communication skills, and it can improve their skills on every subject. Homework Clubs

Imagine getting all of your work completed easily and correct! A homework club are for students that is having a difficult time of getting their work done, they can also do their work together as a class. So I suggest that students should do homework clubs to get their work done.

Third, It improves their learning skills. For example, when I was in 4th grade, I didn't know a single word in English so I was in this program called, English and Second Language, where they taught me new words everyday until I started talking English in class and to other students. I really didn't like doing homework but I learned something from it so I started doing my work since I was grounded.

Second, students can help each other. It helped me bring my grades up from a failing to a passing. For example, back in 7th grade, I didn't really do my homework and I knew that I didn't make the right choice so the consequences were having a bad grade, and being grounded for a long amount of time",0
"If we abandoned the phones they would still not follow direction so why even try to abandoned them, that's why I say we should allow the school to have phones out in there free time and if they catch us with the phones they should not take them away. Including our music we would like to here it only when we are taking a test or we are doing an assignment quite and that you wont bother any people. They should just say can you please put your phone away.. I think we should have phones in school only when we have free time on our own and when we are in class we should finish our assignment first and that's when we should have phones out",0
"Because since SOL's are like right around the corner I've been singing to just get my mind off everything that's stressful. So we had another one then I won.

Singing has been helping me relieve my stress a lot lately. This one time we did a singing contest that went on for hours and it turned out to be a tie. We'll do singing contests. I sing whenever I'm sad and then I choose a song and I'll sing to the song I chose and it'll make me happy.

Me and my best friend play around a lot and when we do we'll start singing but in a fun way. I also felt very happy to sing, after singing I was energetic.

In conclusion,

I think that singing is very fun and helpful and it can also get your mind off anything that bothers you.. Something I'd like to accomplish in the future would be to practice my singing because it makes me happy, it can turn into fun and games with your friends, it helps relieve my stress, and you can freestyle when you sing. Once I'm done singing a song I'll have the urge to sing more because I love to sing. I felt relieved to sing because I hadn't sung in quite a while. Lastly, I think that singing is very fun and helpful.

Singing makes me happy because whenever I'm done singing a song it makes me smile. We'll be so off key. Ever since I was a little girl I would occasionally ask my dad to sing to me and ever since then I've always been passionate about singing. So we did a rematch and she won that rematch. And start goofing around",0

""Commit a career at a young age gives time for students to approach their goals and advance towards the future""

During High School, many Juniors and Seniors are already preparing themselves for college, taking classes that would give them credit and would benefit them as they go, also there are some classes that would provide students lots of experiences, these experiences prepared students in a way for them to see how much effort they must put to approach their goal.

The Board of Teachers in a private school have said that, ""The more early a student starts their way to a career, the less struggle is for them to accomplish it"", because at their young age they have more time, less worries and not that much of responsibility, as a person gets older the more problems and responsibilities come to them, Although students also have many struggles in school, their house etc, is more less then an adult, That is why teachers think that is better for a student to commit a career at a young age because they are less worried.

The percentage of students that commit a career at a young age is high, many of this students received a schoolarships others financial help, because of their behavior and their effort,The other half of this percentage of students have a well financial situation and there is no need for help or schoolarships, although there is a low percentage of students that prefer to work instead of going to college, because of their financial situation,However many students with low financial situation have succeed at their young age because of their effort to accomplish their dreams by working hard and knowing what they want to succeed in.

Commiting a career at a young age could be difficult or it could be simple, there is more students that had said that is a great idea, because your mind at a young age is envolving in everything that surrounds the student, such as important information that would benefit him, as i said, the brain has more potencial to store as much information as it can, because the student is young and is focus on its goals and there is no problems or thoughts that could disstract the student.

Other students had said that is a bad idea in a way of making the biggest decisition, which is choosing what career you want to accomplish, because at that age they do not actually know what they really want.

Parents and the societies have a big influence when students are choosing which path to go, some parents wants their kids to follow their steps, so they encorage their kids to take courses that would help them as they go, parents would always want the best for their kids more when its about their future.

Accomplishing a career at a young age brings many benefits, one of them is that the person not longer have to be thinking about it, takes a big weight off their shoulders, also the person would have more time for the family and especially the person would have many opportunities to find a job, because that person is young and lots of doors would be open for them.

As we see commiting a career at a young age has many advantanges the biggest one is that, the students approach their goals and advance towards their great future.. Generic_Name

"For example, every person in the group give opinions. Working alone is fine because we don't get headaches from classmates; however, working in in groups is better because we get extra help from classmates. There will be more help and each person will do a little work what means that we will finish faster because it will take us less time doing the assignment than do it alone.

And the older students can the younger students and they can show them which room they have to go. And its better this way beacuse the older students knows more things about the school then the younger students do. I think this pogram should be in every school beacuse this could help the younger students to learn more about the school. And the younger students gonna learn from the older students and this pogram can help the younger students get their grades up beacuse older students can help them do they work and get their grades up. And if this was not a thing students will be all sad and fustrated beacuse they will be all lost beacuse they new to the school and wont have no one to help them. This will make the students feel about their seld beacuse they were helping other younger students. Now the srudents feel more comfortable beacuse they got helped from the other students from the other students so now the younger students feel way happier beacuse they know where to go. And this could help the younger students learn more about the school. So this a reason of why every older students should help new kids at the school or any younger students. The younger students going to be really sad beacuse they wouldnt know what to do and what class they have to go,0

"Also, going to Disney and trying games or riding any type of game is going to bring you enjoyment. Most zoo's can be a little boring, but you can find a way to have lots of fun. Most people like to spend time alone or with their family members. It will take you the stress that you have, and you will forget everything that you been going through. For example, if you watch Disney princesses, you can go and meet them in real life, and talk to them. Find a way to have some fun outdoors and all the things that keeps you stress are going get away in a second. For example, going to the Bahamas is a great place to go, looking at museums of what had happened in that place. I would prefer someone should go to and spend time with their family, or just to have fun such as going to the zoo, going to Disney or travel to a different state where you live.

The first reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go to the zoo. Most people like to spend time with their families outdoors such as going to community parks, state parks, and national parks. You can learn new things about animals and the history, and it can be interesting and fun at the same time. Have you ever wonder how many enjoyable activities are outside of the world? They're thousands of enjoyable activities outside the world. Not everyone likes to go outside to spend time with their family, or go to a place to have fun because they don't like to go outside that much, but most of the times you need to go and look around what's around the world. Also, going to the beach in the Bahamas is another way to have fun, the beach is going to relax you in a type of way that you will not imagine. In my opinion, the zoo is a great place and a great activity to have fun.

The second reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go to like a Disney park.

A large of number of people that I have known go to Disney to have fun with their family members. For example, at a Disney park you can go and try different games there, eat some different type of food that you haven't tried yet, and go and take picture of princesses that you really want to meet. . Have fun with all the people that you love and that is around you because spending time with them and going to parks with them is the best feeling that you ever will ever have. For example, at the zoo you can learn some interesting facts about every kind of animal that are you very interest in. The zoo can bring you lots of fun, and enjoyment such as taking pictures with the animals, giving the animals their food, and touching and giving love to the animals that are in the zoo. Exploring the world, or trying new things from a different state or country is a type of having fun, You can got to different parks, different beaches, and different restaurants where you can try different type of foods that you haven't even tried and that are the bets. Also, giving lots of love to the animals like talking to them or touching them is a way to be relax. In my opinion, Disney is the second best place to go and have fun by yourself or with the people that is around you.

The third reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go and travel to a different state, or country that they have never been to. In my opinion, going to different countries, or different states that you have never been is the third reason why it's a great idea to go and have lots of fun.

Many people like to have fun in different ways not just being outside. There's different types of way to have fun at different places not only going to the zoo, going to Disney a park, or going to a place that you have never been or explore what is it like to be in another country. Spending time in something that you really love is a great feeling that you will have experience in your life",0
"       . People should'n need an expert for their life important matters,they should'n be trusting other people you can create your own ideas, you never know at the end of the day how things can result you may need an expert you may not.

In my opinion having an expert for your lifematters is not the best idea, but for people that are old they may need a life important matter because they need other people to help then with their stuff, people should'n be trusting other people with their benefits or lifematters.

You may not know the person you never know how big of a deal can be at the end of the day they can take everything from you or they can be stilling your stuff without you knowing, i would rather manage my own life then being attach to somebody else.

being able to manage your own life make it easier for yourself, you can make your own ideas and decisions with out anyones consentiment, and you can achieve everything by doing it.

Having an expert for your lifematters is not neccesary for your life is just a waste of money by hiring or having one, you can depend from yourself or your family if you ever struggle on life.

Because people from those companies may treat you well and confortable, but you never know with what intentions they're donig it.

Not having a lifemattercan complicate your life style in some ways,your health is not secure you need to pay a lot of money for the hospitals but it aslo helps you how to live your life and teachs you how to manage your own buissnes and decisions, you can only depend on your self everybody should know their instincts; they should'n be scare to manage their own life at their own risk, you need to challenge your self of how live life with your own decisions.

In conclusion people should'n have life matters experts because, at the end of the day you never know how life can changes you ,so you need to live your life with your owns decisions and your own instincts, you need to create your ideas and achieve then with your consentiment and your own risk you need to be yourself with yourself and take care of your life style and your own buissnes",0
"Some school are offering distance learning ash an opportunity for a student attend classes from home by way of online or video conference. I think this would be a good idea because is offering a good opportunity for people that can not be able to attend the school during the morning for other occupation personal and give a chance to get the diploma .Also is good opportunity to the people the can not be able to attend classes because they work. But is amazing that can take one class online without attend to school that's a lot of benefit for people that don't work .Is offering a big opportunity to take the class at home and do not drive every day to the class in the school.

Being able to to attend classes by home online is a good opportunity because not all school is offering the chance to take classes by home online. Is good opportunity for the people that can not attend classes and miss school because they do not have transport to go school. and Also they don't have to find a transport to go to the school every day they only have to join online and make the work.

Finally i think this opportunity is huge benefit for the people the don't have the chance to go the school and for those students that need to graduated because they have to do a lot of think but want to get his diploma this can be the best opportunity for those people that want to be some one in his future some people have to work hard every day and they don't have good opportunity to finish they high school but in this school they offering a huge benefit that give to us a opportunity to take classes online that's going to be for me the best opportunity the i never seen before in schools .. for instance The students would be better doing the class online because when they go to school they get a lot of distracted and not put attention to the teacher when they talk .But online no body is making noise by your side and interruption to you that's helping to you a lot .Is good benefit to can graduated and doing all the think well online at home.

Some student can be more benefit because they have to work and be able to do online is good opportunity to all students can finish the school. Taking classes online can improve the student and offering the opportunity to graduate without attend the schools and miss classes for not reason. For example they can finish extra work after they work a long they and be able the pass the grade doing all the step at home without go the school and miss the class offering the opportunity to do online without going anywhere just by doing online can be more benefit because can not be more stressing like in the school when you have to do a lot of work do not get the correct time to do it ,but when with this opportunity can be the best option to can finish late and extra work. But with the opportunity doing online student can make the class and not skip school and class for not reason.

Student can learn more with this benefit doing online because they can no get distracted by his friend of the side and can get more focus in the class online. This would be more benefit because some student skip classes when they go to school so they are losing his grades",0
"I had an idea to make a letter and a big poster with some illustrations to make those children happy, but we didn't because my partners didn't want to make the poster and we only did the letter. . I did my presentation about the alcohol, and she congratulated me because the hard work that I did.

She told me that she was glad about me because I did the best presentation from the class. I will give three reason and examples about why I think working alone is better than working with a group.

To follow at what my brain tells to me is the best decision I can ever do. And also, each group have to pick their topic about what are you going to present she said. that's why I always believe that is better to work alone.

In my English class, the other day teacher made some groups, and each group had to make an essay about the contamination of earth. Work requires a lot of concentration. That day the teacher told us to make a surprise to the children with cancer. I was in a group of four, I was trying to do my best by reading a book about earth and what causes earth get pollution, when one of my partners stopped me by removing the book that I had, that made me really angry, and now that makes me over thinking that working alone is one of the best choice that one person can make.

I remember the last year here at Generic_School, Generic_Name my health teacher told the class to make some groups for presentations about drugs and its diseases that these can cause. That's why I always prefer to work alone, so no body can interrupts what I think.

In conclusion, these years really changed my point of view because now I think that working alone is one of the best choices that a human can make because it makes a person over think and believe more in their self. I asked her if I could make the presentation by myself and she told me that I can, but it may be difficult for you because it is hard to explain in front all your partners she said. I remember one time when I was in middle school, I was working with a group of five students. At Generic_School, I prefer to work alone because I do what I think, no body interrupt me and I concentrate better when I am by myself. Now I am ready to continue with this adventure",0

"for example student may graduate early becuase of they're responsibilities outside of school, students may have goals in life that they want to accomplish first or a student just wanted a time off school. Students may want to acoomplush it early as possible. Graduating early may help them to get a head start so they wont be falling behind with people. Graduating earlly should be a good idea because students are abkt to accomplish it early, students may have goals in life they want to achive and they might have other responsibilities to take care off. Some poeple said that graduating early is a good idea becasue students can relive some stress but some student say that is not a good idea because students may miss the best year of thier life. You have a chose. For example my friend had a kid. Going to school is stressfull enough for students, Exams, Sol, Text, ect. take it or leave it.. Graduating early can be a good idea. She graduated early last year, now shes able to go to college or go to work force while taking care of her kid. Students may be sick of going to school because of how many lesure are there everyday. He wanted to step back for a bit before going to college. Beach Fc or anyone soccer club out there may help those players become a pro.

Seconly. I read a story once that a guy that graduted early. If I can graduate early, I can accomplish my goals early than others. Students may have goals in their life that they wanted to accomplish early after school. He became a proffetional soccer player on are 17 or 18. For example soccer players can go professional without going to college. Students may want to graduate early becasue thet want a time off school before going to college. Students may have work or some issue that are not school base things. Students may have a sport team that are able to help they turn into a pro. if a student can graduate, they can focus on other responsinilities outside of school. students have a lot of goals in there life also. Some student may have sport team outside the school that may help them to be professional player. Students use this meated to have a years off school before going to college or going stright to work force,

Thirdly. He is a incredible player, One of the best in the world.

If a student could graduate early; the students can accomplish things that they couldn't after highschool. So thinking about it, should you graduate early or not.

First of graduating early is a goog idea because of the responsiblity a student have outside of school. For example my friend graduate early last year because he wanted to get it done early. or a gaming team to turn them a pro",0

"at night. People would rather stay at home than going out at night. Everyone has freedom to do what they want, others cannot force teenagers to stay at home everyday after 10 p. Staying at home not only keep teenagers safe, it also make them be caution to everything around them. They can stay at home and do something productive and meaningful to themselves. No one knows what is going to happen next. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers because they can have more time to spend with their family. m. Have you ever thought of the affect of going out after 10 p. To sum up, it is nice to have curfews because it helps build up a better relationship.

In conclusion, it is the best idea to have a city council adopt curfews for teenagers because it can protect teenagers from danger and risk, they will less likely get into future conflicts, and they can have an enjoyable time to spend with their family. m. Instead of going out with people below standard and breaking the rules, teenagers can have a wonderful time with their family at home. Spending time with their family is the best moment that nobody wants to miss. Let's make the adoption of curfews come true! . In short, it is necessary to adopt curfews for teenagers because they will be safer.

Additionally, it is important for teenagers to have curfews because they can stay out of trouble. Teenagers nowadays have a very playful mind and they would do anything to enjoy themselves; however, they can get into trouble very quickly. In some cases, for instance, teenagers might have an emergency or something important at night that they need to be there as soon as possible, city council cannot let them stay at home. at night? Night time is the scariest period of the day; nothing is more dangerous and harmful than at night. It is very scary if teenagers hang out at night because someone might follow or kidnap them without they notice. Therefore, a city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because they can stay out of trouble.

Lastly, it is a great idea for a city council to adopt a 10 p. m. Curfews can raise the world to a higher level and make a clean society for all teenagers. Although some people think that having curfews are not a good idea, I still insist that the adoption of curfews for teenagers would be a fantastic idea.

In the first place, a city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because it is safer. Moreover, curfews can prevent teenagers to meet harmful people outside of the society and make a bad decision. Curfew benefits both teenagers and the law. A city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because it is safer, teenagers can stay out of trouble and they can have more time to spend with their family.

However, some people think that curfews would unfairly interfere in young people's lives because they might have an emergency and everyone has freedom to do what they want. It will be unfair if other people can go out at night, but not teenagers. Furthermore, teenagers need to protect themselves from others, so that they will not get hurt. Curfews can prevent and stop teenagers from breaking the law. Because of curfews, the relationship between teenagers and their family will grow and be healthier",0
"For example when during the winter most of my family who lives abroad or out of states would never come to visit us during the winter break because they said it winter and it really cold, while in the summer each and everyone of our family would come to visit because we spend some quality time together and they always give me some good advice on how to be successful on my education and what goal I should set to gain my success.

Finally though other are thinking that students should have a year round school where there would be a three to four weeks in the summer and a longer winter break but meanwhile a week off in spring and fall break because during snow days the students would have no school and they would get to go to school while it really cold outside. For instance the school would have to take a week off of that summer break so that the teacher would have time to complete what he or she has to teach the students. Given students a long summer opportunities would give them the chance to take a restful break from all the ethic school year they have being having.

Most students enjoy summer break vacation. With this opinion, I think am little bit agree because during the winter the snowy weather kind of disrupt everything or activities that was supposed to happened during the school year. I think no because they would be giving an excuse about the snowy weather and the real cold weather and schools would be canceling which would affects the process of curriculum on what the class are learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  . Meanwhile another hands the students does not have to missed a week or weeks to school but a day or two. Therefor they should get a long summer break even tho they would gets a week or two off, for instance I believe if they get a a day or two there would be no chances for them to forgets everything they learned during the time school opens to the beginning of winter. but some educators feel that the summer is too long because students has a long summer vacation would take the time to review their school year and go to summer school for makeup class while others are planing to spend time with their families . I think it not a great idea because Most students thinks the long summer is a great opportunity for them to participate in some various positive activities and for them to sets a standard goal for themselves.

Most students should get a long summer break because they have to take their time and review their work and go to summer school for a make up class that would help them to get credits back or graduates the coming years. Though others are thinking that students should have a year round school where there would be a three to four weeks in the summer and a longer winter break but meanwhile a week off in spring and fall break because during snow days the students would have no school and they would get to go to school while it really cold outside. but some educators feel that the summer is too long because students has a long summer vacation would take the time to review their school year and go to summer school for makeup class while others are planing to spend time with their families .

because Most students thinks the long summer is a great opportunity for them to participate in some various positive activities and for them to sets a standard goal for themselves. for example if they miss one or two days they would have a day to revised their notes and maybe be prepare for a coming test or quiz in the future, never the ;less they wont have to study for too long for a test or quizzes again.

In conclusion

Most students enjoy summer break vacation. Imagine have in a break during the summer, would any students have the chances of making up class work during the winter? or would they even think about the ideas of doing a class makeup?. for example during the winter when we sometimes gets a snowy weather we cancel schools and that one day that school get cancel it affects most teachers planing on what they should do for that day. Though others are thinking that students should have a year round school where there would be a three to four weeks in the summer and a longer winter break but meanwhile a week off in spring and fall break because during snow days the students would have no school and they would get to go to school while it really cold outside. And I believe that students should always have the opportunity to have a long break especially a long summer break. Most students who spends some quality time with their family might have a better chance of setting up a goal for the next school year by all means because they are getting a better advice from their family, for example I had a understanding that students who spent the most time with their family discussing their school year would get motivated and has a goal for themselves before the new school year, meanwhile in the winter break, you wont have that much time to spend with your family, because most of your family who live far across would most likely not want to come visit because of the winter. Therefor students needs a longer summer break to succeed on their goal.

Meanwhile other students need a long summer breaks to spend a long time with their families because they has already spend a long school learn especially the once that had honors class also the students who are in college",0

". This prompt is about some people that need help to make their own decisions or need someone to told what they need to do even in their personal life.

The question say "" should people make their omn decesions, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters?"" some people they will said that is better if someone as came and make there decisions in everything so, they don't need to worry about anything.

There are another person that think that is way to much because how someone that they don't know is gonna make their decisions and also the dicisions of their life.

This is a big topical because like I said before so many people can desagree with this but there are other that are agree with this,in my opinion I'm desagree with this becuause is my life and I need to leard how to deal with it. Even if my life is the worse one I going to take care of all my decesions sometimes we can ask at someone for a opinion maybe, because the person is more older then me but is only a opinion you're not gaving authorities at all at the person to go and make your decisions and then take care of all your stuff.

In my conclusion is better if you take care of your on stuff doesn't matter how hard that it, is your life and you are the only one that knows how to deal with everything that you have done so, this is my last decision people should make their own decisions",0
"A big percentage of people want to be rich, and my way to think about it, is that all thing that's material it doesn't have a real value for a great and humble person, the value is something that makes you having a great family, a simple life, because the world need to be protected by several and carefully people that are interesting in show another face to represent a different type of humanity.

Be an individual person is how you you can to do to confront the reality and give another perspective to make a great research in your your period of life to change or keep using that type of life and really cares about what are you doing with an specific and central idea.

I have a positive and big action to say that Emerson is right because nobody wants to be the shadow of any person or leave an opportunity that will make the life of one or more person to decide to experiment a new way to see the society and doing the correct process to be an excellent human with integrity and feeling of better life.

My conclusion for this restatement is that I want to be myself with great intentions to form an integrity in this society and have the best recognition to prove that it's possible to make and develop a proper identity with a new perspective to imagine and be the next person in the world that makes you a connection with your interior and have peace to concentrate in own goals that will converting on a genuine person to be autonomous of your acts, be someone responsible, charismatic and all of these characteristics define your personality it doesn't matter where yo come from or where you at, just be an example that if I can do this, you can do it better than me and better as you want. When you have a purpose that everyday make changes in your personal life or something like motivation to do anything that that have a great value to demonstrate to you family that they are the base to all of your goals have worth. Every single person will try to impress to your attention to turn down your attitude and your positive life, I have too many experiences that I never want to pass that process again, in this world exist all type of people that want to help, to destroy your intention or the ways to see the real things, you're a guide and an example to change the format in this age. When you think to be a real person and someone different to the rest, you need to have a plan that consist step by step and develop that plan in the course of your life to make goals to short time and large period of time, be patient with each little detail that you want to do.

For example:

If yo want to do something that you think that is impossible for any reason, you don't have to leave that idea or goal that you have in mind, remember that all you need is work hard, be simple and don't complain for any problem or reason that tomorrow will have a lot of consequences.

At this time, the people and no one wants to see another person having their own goals or their dreams that they had when they were children. I'm agree with Emerson's restatement, in my point of view or personality I can say that I want to be a different person with another qualities, create other ways to think how big or how much I can do to show to the world my authentic and proper knowledge, when I have to make a decision I don't have to think too much about it, I believe in what I'm doing.

"now with the new technology, we do not need to move. For example, many years ago we had to go the store and we watched the stuffed we need. I take this opinion for the chaning on our life and the support positive in the knowledge.

First reason, for saying the the tecnology have good effects on the human's life is it helps to do many activity fast and easy. we can bay only.

Second reason, tecnology gives support to the knowledge with the creation of new tools and more precision.

For example, before we used the telescopes for treated to understand the universo, now the technology us helps with the creation of new satellite .

Thrid reason, that support the tnechnology have good effects in our economy. My position about technology is this brings many effect positive for us huminity life. For example on market every people want to down the price of production, the new technology helps on this.

In conclution, technology shows to good change on human's life,

in the economy, in the konwlege and many areas technology helps.",0
"I agree that it is okay to not do anytime sometimes because everyone needs a break in their lives. There is always something to do in this world; we accomplish more when we aim higher. If a whole country can accomplish so much from not being lazy then imagine what a person can accomplish.

I believe there are people who supports on being idle more that have to do work. the country was poor, people died because of huger, disease etc but now the country has accomplished so much then the people in our past would have imagined. We had a government who let the country run free, this had a great impact to the country. I dont blame Inventions and discoveries because they were made with good intentions and not through idle ism but there are people who trust inventions more then they have to. We talk about the American Dream a lot but being lazy and just waiting for something to happen will not take us anywhere.

As Thomas Jefferson said, ""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"", I agree that if we always do something we accomplish more.

We as human beings have so much potentials in us but we will never discover it through inactive.

Firstly, I believe that inventions and new discoveries have made people more lazy and inactive. If we could just go out and just help one person and day, that person would help another and another to another, this would be such a great accomplishment.

In conclusion, I agree on what Thomas Jefferson said and believe that there is more happiness in doing something everyday then being a idle. Imagine the president and the government of our country being nothing but idle and letting the country run on its own. I hope everyone see's how much bad impact idle is in our lives.. Technologies serve their own purpose but we have our own purpose, we are born to do something big. laziness is a big wooden door which can only open by ourselves and once we open that door, theres always something big waiting to happen and once we accomplish that another big adventure awaits.

In the history of United States, there were many people who idolized idle. The history would repeat itself and many of the tragic historical events that happened in the past would happen again. The country is well know all over the world now. The country has accomplished by establishing government regulation which removed all the laziness from the country. There are people who believe in not having to go outside their house because they have all the technologies or they think they have nothing to do. Even small chores prepare us for something big. There would be no regulation in the country",0
"First impressions are very hard to change because the majority of people judge you on the first thing they notice about you, it can be your appearence or the way you act.

Although I think first impression are almost impossible to change there are people who thinks that it is not hard to change first impressions , and they may be not wrong also, because there are people who give you an opportunity to start over and show them that you are different; However even if there are some ways you can change the impression that someone has about you, there are more reasons why it is almost impossible to change first impressions.

To conclude first impressions are almost impossible to change and people should be more carefully about first impressions.                   . Because it is very hard to change the way a person thinks. Then they just keep their distance or go away and you can not do anything to change their opinion. Sometimes when you tell them you are a different person, they won't give you a chance to demostrate if is true, and they will just keep the idea they already have. And when people already have an idea of how you are it is very hard to make them think different. and also it can affect your reputation. People who knew you time ago and did not see you again they will keep the idea that they have about you, even if you already change.

Sometimes you meet people in the wrong moment, and they get a bad impression about you. It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change and I agree with that statement, because it is hard to change people's mind and the way they think about you.

When someone know you or see you for the first time, the way you act, speak or the way you look is what they use to create an idea of how you really are. First impressions are very important because that is the way people know you",0
"People can also hear what another student can up with in their own ways. If I came up with new ideas i can share my ideas with the group i'm in. In a group we can also check each others paper to see what they came up with. If one person doesn't get something another person can come up with other ideas. If we work together the more we learn. Students can also correct themselves if they messed up on a word.

Second, working in groups is another idea of working with partners. We can all work together to come up with new ideas so that our paper makes sence.

Third, by learning more we can get the hang of using that learn strategy. Coming up with new ideas to improve our writing. we acn also revise our paper to each other and hear what each others paper needs correction.

In conclusion, working in groups, learning more, and discuse in groups are reasons why i chose partnership. I chose partnership because of diccuse in groups, work in groups, and learn more.

First, discusing in groups is one thing that partnership is. I can also learn new things just by hearing what a student came up with. Working with partners brings new ideas in each others work.. If someone didn't puncuate a sentence correctly we can find a good puncuation to place it so that it would sound right. In group we can talk about each others paper if we think there should be a puncuation ore if a word is spelled wrong. From partnership you can learn and hear what other people come up with. People can help one another if they are having trouble understanding something",0
"Student can""t really get it they need some one to be beside them in tell them or teach them I really wonder if there were only one student or a lot because is program but if it was only one person they really can concentrate that really good because there a lot lot if there was more than one person it fine because it will be more help that the main effect if there was only one person in not a lot of them in was a big problem with then.if there were talking to much it was big problem for the program.

5. I don't understand her nothing at all but I think because different language but asking some else in the program she explain the easy way i cant understand her.

4. Older kinds have difficult time to teach young kinds they have different way that there teacher teach them how to there work. 1. paying attention is really good thing so the student can really get the work they can get in learn what they do. Like some time i explain my sister what is bad but some time i don't know so I ask in adult to explain me really well that how in school work to young kinds may not really get the older kinds a younger need a adult to understand it well.

3.I go to a program is about math but i really understand because we share opinions of different work they do like student have com plenty different work they have it the hard way in the easy way student get more confused when they have com plenty different work like my math teacher I have different completely different work. Like me I understand it with a adult like PROPER_NAME that one my teacher i can listen to him but some with younger them me or alder them me. The most important is if the young student get it if they don't get it they will fell the test because the older one properly know but can explain can find the easy way so the student can understand it really understand it good they really more information how to treat the student in explain it good make sure it good to them make sure not to just yell at them you have to have passion. talking with some one like your age understand it all of us have different kind of ways to explain it in to learn it. Many kinds can't understand because the different subject.Young student don't really get the work that older kinds do.    . It really hard to know there work in explain the way we explain the kinds the better they understand what they supposed to do.We have to have a lot of passion to do it.

2.I think many student don't really get it because they older student some student don't really get it some of them dont get it fast but some of them need more extra work with it.Older student some time they explain good more then the teacher but for me it better in adult because will ask question in they know well because they teacher. It really hard to teach young kinds because some older student don't even remember the work from any grade like me some time time my little sister be like can you please help me in be like am sorry dont even remember it really difficult to teach a young student",0

"In some societies, some students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Their mind would be thinking about stuff for their careers. Sometimes would be hard for them to do double work, but as they focus and work hard, they would complete a lot in life. Students would always like to have good future over everything. For example, Generic_Name was a student from Generic_school, she choose to start commit to a career when she was 17 years old. Students have the opportunity to be more successful in their careers. Also, students would have more opportunity in life, and they would develop more as a person.

To conclude, people would always say that students should no be start a career at a young age. But, she planned to get better lifestyle. They going to take things more serious for their life.

Secondly, start a career at a young age it's important for students because it allows a lot of opportunity. If students commit to a career at a young age, they would be develop in different ways. Start things at a young age always have good benefits for students and people in general.. It was hard for her because she took a lot of extra classes. For example, sometimes students choose to do other stuff instead do work. For example, people argue that students would be more incline about their career, and the would not enjoy High School as a teenager. It is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? Students should be commit to a career at a young age because it helps students to develop more and it allows a lot of opportunity for many students.

First, start a career at a young age it's important for students because it would helps to develop more. But start at a young age would be the best choice for students in life. Thus, start thing at a young age students would success more.

However, some people may argue that students should not be commit to a career at a young age because students would not enjoy High School. It would be amazing if students start when they enter High School. For example, students would have more stuff to do, more homework. The courses of study in High School are selected to guide them toward a specific career. She work really hard to complete what she want. Some students really want to success and get everything in life. However, start at a young age would be benefit for students because they would take High School as serious part of life. By, Generic_Name start a career at a young age was the best option she did in her life, she have a lot of opportunity, she can work wherever she want to",0

Second of all, willing something is just the first part to change our first impression. Challenges are part of life, so don't see them as impossibles, but see them as oportunities.

"Then you stop and you think what happen to that person that did the same mistake you were about to do. Is important to learn from other people experiences? The answer is yes, because they don't want you to do the same that they did. He had tell me plethora of experiences that he had when he was young. One day, you are about to do something wrong, but then you realized that someone that you know did it before, and they had already tell you that it didn't went well. Almost every week he used to lived the house without permission. You would shared that experiences to your children, grandchildren, and others, because you would not like them to commit the same mistake. t.c. Next, when people tell you their experiences, they want you to do better them what they did. You already know what not to do when you grow up, because someone had already tell you not to do it. Maybe your grandfather, parents, friends, e. He tell me his experiences, because he want me to learn that is your are below 18 you still have to ask permission to you parents to do anything.

Next, when people had tell you their experiences that they had when were young. Furthermore, they want you to do successful in life.. In this essay I would talk about why is important to learn others people experiences. In conclusion, maybe when you were young you did something wrong. One of the experiences that he had tell me. had tell you plethora of their experiences that they had. In addition to, they want you to do better them what they did in their best moment of life.

Finally, in my point of view learning the experiences of others is important, because they don't want you to do the same mistake. One day, he realized that he was doing something wrong, so he stop going out of the house without permission. Is that when he had the same that I have, he use to go out of the house without asking permission to his parents. They tell you does experiences, because they don't want you to commit the same mistake that they did in the past.

"I was drawing in my note book and I finished a drawing, but for some reason I did not know what colors I should use. Nevertheless, there may be some times were when you ask people you may get a tie between the two choices, and if you do get a tie just go ask one more person for there opinion.

Many people ask more then seven to eight people some people don't have even numbers, however if you do get a even number there can always be more on one side of the vote or opinions. Asking one person is great! Maybe asking your best friend for there opinion is great and all, but have you tried asking more then one person? However even though asking your friend is great, but have you thought about what other people may be thinking or there opinions on it? Wanting to ask your friends is nice of you, however they could be lieing to you about there real opinion. Like my grandma used to say, ""more votes are more points in life"". Honestly asking people for there opinions are great because you get peoples opinions on which one is the best and which one is the worst.. See almost everybody has asked if they haven't they well soon. There are most likely 10% of people who don't ask for others opinions, and 89% of people who go out and ask people for there info about the topic or there opinion about it.

Go ask your friends or family if they ever asked more then one person for there opinion. Also I gave here my opinion as well, and now she has enough opinions and she knows the one she is going to get. Therefor asking more then on person is better then asking just one, and you get honest opinions on what you may have asked about, or what you may have wanted to know about.

People think if asking more people for there opinions on what they asked about is better then just asking one person about there opinion. Most of them picked the same colors, but my mother and my two sisters all picked the same color.

Therefor, if you ask more then one or two people then you can find out which is the most best out of the two things you wanted opinions on. Even though some times asking more is great you still have to pick which one you like the most if there were to be a tie and you don't want to go ask anymore people for there opinions about the topic if not your fine. Either way the most voted would be best, but if you pick the least liked am pretty sure that other people may not like it. Then I asked my two sisters my mother and my father for there opinions on what colors I should use. For example, somebody wants to know the best why to make some great yummy cookies. My mother want's to get a tattoo, however she doesn't know which one she should get, and she doesn't want to get something that people or here kids may not like.

After she put the pictures of the one's she liked she then put then on Facebook to find out which one people like the most",0
"In our homes old people as grandmother, grandfather, sibblings and parents, need to give the example, so kids will take it, and they will be confident and a positive person.. There was one day that he had a bad day, because one member of his family was in the hospital, and was very delicate, he was an a mood that did not look like he was the same one, he was sad, he was devastated, and worried, because the person that was in the hospital was his wife, she had cancer. When I was in 10 grade, I had an algebra teacher that was always telling us that we had to believed more in ourselves, sometimes we did not do what she asked us to do, because we did not understand, many of us were disappointed of ourselves, because we didn't even try to do it. We though that our score would never change. He was so thankful with us because how we supported him in that bad moments that wanted to increase our salary, many of us accepted, but many others not. He found a new job where he earn a little bit more than his previous job, so our money's problem disappear.

Believe in yourself not always is easy, some times we though that is difficult to understand yourself, but there is always a lovely person that help you to believed in how strong you are, and to see all the thing that you are capable to do. We changed, all of us did, and she became for me the most good person as a teacher and as a friend, she was always supporting us, and teaching us. For that experience that I had, I think that possitive attitude is something extremely important in every human life.

Our attitude has to be always positive, even in the worst moment of our life.

Some people think that a person should have a positive attitude just during a very important moment, or in happy moments, this is not correct, they all are wrong, we need to have a possitive attitude always in order to succeed in life, and to be happy. Until this moment I am thankful with my teacher, because of her, we changed to a better score, because of her we believe more in ourselves, she just wanted our best, but sometimes we made her get angry, because we did not believed in ourselves. That is why until this moment she is one of my favorite teacher, and I think that for my other classmates she is too. He really change since that days, that many of us, we are still working there, and earning more money than we regurlarly earned.

In every human life, there is always a hard problem, that make us to give up, but there is also a person with a positive attitude that makes us to get up, and continue with our life. Do you think positive attitude is a key that everyone need in order to be a successful person in life? In my essay I will talk about positive attitude, if it is important or not. It was because our teacher talked with us, and made us to believe that we can do anything that we want to do. My father almost immediately changed his attitude, he gave to my mom a big smile and said to her "" Thanks babe to be always with me, and for trust on me"", he get up take the keys of the car, and went out to look for another job. Some time later many of us had changed, as we changed, we saw that our teacher changed too. In my opinion attitude should be always positive, because it can help you to succeed in work, can encourage people to do their best, even if what they have to do is hard to do it, and it can be a great tool in order to succeed in relationships, and believed in yourself.

When I was working in Mango Paradise, my boss was a really bitter person, that was always angry with everyone in the work, but I was one person that I didn't care about his bad attitude toward us, I was always with a big smile, perhap how he treated us. My father was devastated, he was looking for a job amost for three months, and he could not find any job to pay the rent, so we would not lose the house. After that many student changed their attitude, but it was not because we wanted. The second quater passed, and the students were happy because their score in the algebra class, many students's score were from 50 to 90, it happened because all us changed our attitude in different manners. So, that same day I asked him if we may talk, he said "" Yes"", I just wanted to talk with him and tell him that perhap everything, we were there to support him in everything he needed. We paid more attention as we should since the beginning of the year, we started to believe in us, we started to do things even if we didn't know how to do it. Unfortunate, his wife pass away, and as I said to him, we were there all the time supporting him, we were there with a positive attitude telling him, that everything will be okay, that his wife is gonna be in a better place where can rest in peace, where she will not suffer more. As every wife do, my mom came to him and said ""Do not worry sweetheart, we can get out of this problem as we always do, I am here to support you"". There was a time in my family where we had a problem of money, my father got fired on his work, we almost lose the house where we were living, because we did not paid the rent in almost four months. In the first quater many of us in our class period failed",0
And if this was not a thing students will be all sad and fustrated beacuse they will be all lost beacuse they new to the school and wont have no one to help them. And its better this way beacuse the older students knows more things about the school then the younger students do. The younger students going to be really sad beacuse they wouldnt know what to do and what class they have to go. And the older students can the younger students and they can show them which room they have to go. This will make the students feel about their seld beacuse they were helping other younger students. So this a reason of why every older students should help new kids at the school or any younger students. Now the srudents feel more comfortable beacuse they got helped from the other students from the other students so now the younger students feel way happier beacuse they know where to go. And this could help the younger students learn more about the school. And the younger students gonna learn from the older students and this pogram can help the younger students get their grades up beacuse older students can help them do they work and get their grades up. I think this pogram should be in every school beacuse this could help the younger students to learn more about the school,0
"Doing a homework club after school is going to help kids alot.

2.

I think its a good idea but also a bad idea. Teacher want to make a homework clube for student at schools. The reson i think is a bad idea is beacause kids are going to have to stay after school but its bad cause they might have somthing planed. This is going help kids be responsible and learn more. They wont like staying after scchol kids and teens might just think its a waist of time. They might get bored and just might not to there homework. I think they want to start this club so students do there homework for offten and teacher are going to helps you if your need help. Its good and bad cause kids need to learn how to be responsble.

3.

Tenns/kids might think its a waist of time. Hopefully student start doing there homework now.. The reson why i think its good is because it can help kids if they need help. They just mont like it at all.

4. Even tho they might thinks its dumb its not its relly going to help them. i support this because its going to help students out by doing there homework. Students are going to do there homework now",0
"His parents are from Generic_City and Generic_City. Make your own decisions mean that you will do mistakes but you will learn even more from this and it will help you to do thigs better and it also will help you like a human. Remember that just God and family are our friends. Bussiness came down, deppression started to make him use drugs, and after a while he lost everything he had and the expert (person who help him) wasn't there to help him when he really needed him.

If you think you have the capacity to succed on your own, you have to do it and don't let anyone ruin what you have planned for your own future. Help is given by God when you born. I know life isn't easy to live but remember that we just have one and after death we cannot do anything about it. My friend, if you let people maneuver your life, then you will cry and you will not have the future you wanted. Why? if you ask why, and this is because everything you have done it's thanks to someone else not to you, you are not living your own life, youar not having fun, no mistakes, no experiences, no control of your own life. Life depends of you and what you do with it. The way they think and the way they look at other people make them specials and unique. Anyone else is just people we know. Now, what can experts do to change their life or take the control of what they want to do?. That's why you should live your life as you want to live it without anybody help. At first, you can have a teacher during a period of time but it doesn't mean that you will have to go and ask for help everytime you have a problem. People will always try to control your life but you are the one who is going to decide if you want to live the life they want you to live or the one you want to live. Two years ago I met an old man from Washington DC, his name was Generic_Name. As we all know, they cannot do anything and no matter what the situation could be the answer will be the same. Do we have to live other people experiences?

If we want to live our own life you should start by taking a break. Fight for what you really want no matter what comes next.. No matter what happen you have to do what makes you happy always just trusting God. Experts help you to get things but do you really think they will help you when you are really on trouble? or will they help you with things you have to pay? the answer to this is NO. I don't really like to talk about other people life but one example could be Homeless people. We all know that life isn't easy as we want but that's life, we cannot change it. If you put your life in hands of an expert you will have the opportunity to succed but it will feel strange and you will regret later. A person help you to walk and talk and one time you learn this you become an indepentent person. Never try to kill yourself if you don't know what to do it is better if you believe in God and in his help because he is the only one who can help you without taking anything away from you.

Never give up and follow your dreams, live your life as you want to live it but remember that no one can control what you can do if you don't want to. Ask questions, ask for advices and opinions but don't do want they want to do with your life. He gave you two arms, two legs, two eyes and a body. In my opinion they help you because they want something from you or they will try to get something from you after you learn it. There's always going to be a person telling you what to do and if you don't follow his/her directions something could go wrong. Do not live like a robot, don't let anyone take adventage of your incapacity to succed just because you do not know anything. Before homeless he was a mechanic but one day while he was fixing a car he met a person who told him that he could help him to have his own workshop and he accepted. It doesn't matter if he is a proffesional, you just need to learn what you need but never let them maneuver your life. I am not saying that you have to ignore the advices they give you but don't follow their directions.

Nothing is difficult if you really try it and nothing can be impossible if you really want to do it. Think how people would like to live their lifes and then, use this as an example but do not use it for your own. Do everything by yourself and don't let people make you feel useless because God make them the same as you and as everyone else but they have not develop their mental capacity the waht make them special. Their decisions and their style of life before the actual I think were made by someone else and after a while they were not able to pay for what they had. When I said human I mean that you will have your own thoughts about something and your own way to live your life and no like a robot that just follow direction and have no sense of humor.

People will never discover their great mental power because until I know they just develop the 70.3% of their mental capacity and it makes them feel useless sometimes. Everything was good for the first years but after some years the person left the country and Generic_Name didn't have the capacity to manage the whole store. Everyone thinks and look at the as a piece on somethings useless but if you really meet them and talk to them you will realize that they are smart and all they do and what they have in their brains is even better than what we have. Life is going to beat you up, experiences will make you stronger every single day, decisions will make you be independent, and at the end you will see that everything you did was good and you have what you wanted without anybody help. Everything will be destroyed and disgrace will follow you anywhere.

Don't follow experts, be one of them and do your own life, have a family, have a car, an partment or whatever you want to have without asking anyone. If you do everything by yourself people will try to destroy you but be strong and try even more until get what you want",0
"You are in this world to learn and grow. I was to afraid and nervous that I wouldnt be able to ride the bike with training wheels so I didn't let him take them off. I was pretty proud of myself and gave me courage.

Once you've done something in your life that was huge and still did the same thing over and over what would you grow from it. I have learned so much and ready to learn more and to become successful in my life. Being fearless and taking a risk on something, will change me and anyone else to a more powerful and successful person.

When I was young, my parents had gotten me a bike with training wheels, I had started to ride it and it was pretty difficult to ride. I started to get better and better, I was'nt struggling anymore. Year's later, he's a manager at his own company and is being successful in life he's learned that not giving up and risking things to become what he is now is incredible.

Last but not least, if someone is not challenging them self, how would they know that they are good at it and could be able to do so much. The statement Ralph Waldo had wrote is something i agree with and will grow to be successful.. He ends up getting a raise and is the employee of the month for showing that he's a hard worker. So i started to think to myself, ""If i didn't take them off how will I know that im good or horrible"". My parent had saw that I have gotten the hang of it and told me that I should try and do it with out the training wheels. I told my dad to take them off, once he took them off i was pretty scared but then i started to get better and better that i wasn't afraid. To become a stronger, and successful person to accomplish something big and grow from where they have started. The things i have experience and has made me the person I'am today, has taught me that doing the same things will not help me learn and grow. If you believe you can do anything then you are growing and realizing that all you need to do is to be fearless and take risks. If someone was to started off as a employee at McDonald and was thinking of being a manager somewhere and have his own company how could he do that if he's just a worker at McDonald. That's the point of growing. the manger realizes that he's got a big future ahead of him. Ralph Waldo has gave people the courage and make them think that they can do anything to become someone you'd never thought you could be. He told me that if don't take the wheels off, how will I grow and take risks in life when im older and have big things that i'd have to develop and learn what I made a mistake on not doing and learn from my mistake. Every day when I came home from school, I would go outside and ride my bike. My thoughts on what author Ralph Waldo had wrote, is something I can agree with. If he wanted to be a manager and own his own company, he would have to be the hardest worker there and show that he can handle and work and follow all the rules",0
"In conclusion i do agree with the British prime mister Winston Churchill quote that says ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". Do you think failure is a good thing or bad thing? Well, what a British prime minster ones said""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". In order to have that kind of motivation of getting out of bed and doing what you want to accomplish at the end of the day is looking up to someone who helps you get to work or hustle i can say. All these people was in our shoes before they became famous. For example, when i first started learning how to ride a long board i was very afraid that i would fall and hurt myself. Yes,i agree with the statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success because of these three reasons,failure makes me better than i was at first,never giving up without motivation ,and be able to over come that obstacle that i work so hard for. Until one day my friend came over my house and showed him how i would do it. Some people may think this is bad thinking because of how hard you try,but you have no success at the end. They can motivate us by what people probably said to them like ""no"" or ""it can not be done"". something that i always believed in is ""no pain,no gain"". Until one day i was with my best friend in his room just chilling and later on he showed me on his phone what i never though they would do. He also told me he was really proud of me not giving up and failing. But once again i fell off my long board crazy like. They did not listen to adorers Sayers would though that never would happen. related back to my first reason is that not just giving up,but having a motivation every time i do anything to keep going. because of these three reasons failure makes every body better,never giving up without motivation,and lastly over coming any obstacle that can be on road to success. My first reason, of why failure is a good thing because it makes every body better at what they started with. At first i really terrible and failed over and over again. I ask him why he laugh at me,he told me"" i remember at was like you when i stared to learned long board"". what i understood of what he was trying to tell me is that failure can make me better from having that kind of enthusiasm in my spirit. For example, famous people who did or was successful in life like Bill gates who found the gold rush,Arnold the best body builder of all times,and Stan lee who invited the marvel universe. At first they looked like good people,but when i started to notice that they were hiding something from me i was really currouse what was it about. So on that day i had to over come my obstacle of not making friends with anybody who looks nice or their appraise. For example, the time when i was fifteen years old i had a problem with one of my classes in school where i had to learn to stay away from people who were not good influence on me. My final reason of why failure is a good thing is to over come any obstacle that can get in your way.                 . Then my friend started to laugh but in a funny way,so i also stared to laugh too. I was really dissapionted what they were doing beyond my back",0
"One the older student this telling the younger student what to do. And the they will maybe listen to there mom and dad.

How is this program going to help them later on when they have kid's. Then a older person tells you to something. And younger kids how to behave in fort of there parents.

And what i wrote about. And the older student is acting like there parents. In my opinion I think the kid's that don't listen to there mom and dad. And it also teaching they how to respect there orders.

this program is going to help both younger kids and older kids because... Is how is program is going to help they later on in life. its called respect your orders. And one more time it's just going to prepare the older students when they have kid's. then They need this program the most. How it's going to help both older student and younger student. you should do it. Because he or she is telling younger kids what to do and it pretty much just getting ready when they have kid's later on. Then if they do the program for like 3 or more time a week then,the younger student will get use to it. You just have to respect older people. This is for the older one one. Also my opinion on who need this program the most.. Like if u respect other people it dont matter how old you are",0
"We can help person with our experiences, also we can help kids give them a advise because we want a good, strong citizen in this world and they can make it better, and help each other.

In conclusion we can be stronger, healthy for people that don't know anything in this life. We can do better things for our future, furthermore kids will be our future, therefore we are gonna fight for them, and their future because if we are lazy and we don't do anything we are gonna fail. One day we would grow up and we would does not know anything and we're gonna fall in our life, therefor i told them this advice.

Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.""

we can be stronger if we are always doing something because we can learn about everything that we did and we can get strength to be better, also we can be a adviser to other peoples for example: Kids, Teenager, also Adults.

We can be helpful if we are always doing something because one day that we fall down, also we can stand up more stronger and healthy. Can we accomplish more if we are always doing something ?

Sometimes we are lazy and we don't want to do nothing, but if we are doing always something we can be more stronger and helpful to the citizen.

Sometimes we are lazy, but that is bad in our life because we has to learn about this life and prepare for the future and other things. We need more activities in our life and do something all the time because for that we can learn ah be adviser, also we need a break but we has to continue learning and to be success in our life, and complete our dreams.",0
"Unless you really dont try at all you will never grow even if you have put your best effort your best part you will grow and become a person that others are just going to admiral you.

could you really learn from life yes!! you can be aware of it but hey!! we are not perfect nobody was born perfect we can make as many mistakes we can or we could be the greats but no theres nobody perfect that could tell you that you cant do something when you know more then anybody else that you can and that you are not perfect. If you want to be a great person dont thought of yourself you know you could do it you could grow of it other people would love so any wonder things and person you really are.

being positive of your self is the most amazing thing you could do like for example you could be positive and just be like i will pass a test or i will pass but you are just being positive that you are sure you could do it because not you only are positive of yourself you are also showing that you could believe that you can do it. honestly you grow of some many ways you didnt have no idea you could but you still get through it.

be someone in life is about growing little things you have left out to make them bigger. Dont stop trying do not ever make yourself feel like you gotta do things for other people just be great how you are with or without mistakes you could be wonderful and make yourself happy and proud of them.

In life theres so many responsibilities you have to take care of and no matter what does responsibilities are you still take care of them you dont give up because if you do you wouldnt be able to go to school and becoming someone in life you wouldnt be able to to eat you wouldnt be able to work or to do many things but you stills do them because you have to and because you do become someone out of them you become a person that graduates a person that works everyday to put food in the table a person that after words its gonna be proud for they have done and that is always good enough and that you grow everyday from it. you could take a risk of many things you want to do in life and become something wonderful of it. It doesnt matter how people make you feel at the end of the day it would only be you and your family and the effort to put on the things you want to become the best not perfect but the best. being organist with your self is less stress full because you dont got worry about get so many things out of your way the same day. you could become a person that could afford a car with nobody asking help and you grow everyday with or without people because you are strong like that. you can graduate and became someone you wanted to, thats growing masterly of no matter how many times you have try but where has got you.

Be a person with so many mistakes but the also is going to learn from them and,you will still come back up and start trying again.

If you have done so many things and you still feel like no other person is going to appreciate of the things you have done and then you feel like theres nothing that you could do that could be good enough for nobody. Believing in yourself is always something that is gonna help you to a positive person.

Making good choices in your life is another part of you not just because sometimes you learn from them or where they could take you but how you get when you learn from your bad choices and how sometimes you react and you say to your self that you just want for your self to do good things.

Dont ever in your life say that your things are never worth of any tries you have made because the're really are worth of every single part of your life there are step you always take. theres another step where family comes along and you got to be able to take care of your family you got to get your family food you gotta get then clothes you gotta get them shoes you gotta get them the most important things they need and you still get your family out of any circumstances you still get up every morning to get your money and help your family or each other up and you still grow from not just growing from it but you also get to know how something people get to appreciate what you really do for them. Sometimes is just matter of time for you to really tell yourself that you could try your hardest and not give because life is not about just being a completely fail nope you could tell youself you can do it because you got it.

""BE SOMEONE BEYOND OF OTHERS CUZ YOU GOT IT"". Happy is showing every body that no matter they think about you you dont pay any attention to them even if you have try your best to become friends and it still not even working out so you just gotta leave the person and just let it be you just gotta show the person that you did try and if for that person your friendship wasnt good enough then dont bother. As my opinion i disagree because ""you could be someone beyond the world"" if you are positive of yourself",0
"Do we accomplish always doing something, that quastion can be answerd in different ways on the tipe of person that you ask; theres people that are accomplished with what they do, but theres people that not like to do their stuff because maybe they do not like to do what they are doing, or its hard to do it or they are just tired of it. For people that like to do what they do they have some stuff that make them feel acomplishwith what they do for example:

The space are were they work at.

The relation ship that they have with other workers to work together .

How hard is the job that they are doing that makes them feel comfrontable.

In the other heand the people that do not like what they do, they don't feel accomplish for this reasons for examole:

The work area is not comfortable to them.

The people do nt have a good relation ship with the workers.

The work is to hard since no one likes to help echader.

In my way of think I would pick that i feel accomplish with what I'm doing because maybe is hard or I dont feel comfrontable odoing it, but I enjoi doing it is something that i considere accomplihsment for; Im the one who is doing it that nothing is going to change it and Thomas Jefferson was right it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing it.

My conclution is that if we have to enjoy what we are doing even if is something that we dont like to do, or is just a person that you are working with is not good enght to work with , but it doen's not matter about what you do your idias that you have made the work that they did and the prgres that could be helpfull to expire you to do more thing to feel accomplished with your self.",0

"I believe that peoples always try to overcome in life, that's why you always have to try progress in life and grow up and not be an conformist. Sometimes they don't take the opportunity they just throw it on the trash.

Like the feeling of a person they don't fight fort that they can be a big house a lot of money but they can't feel the love that someone has for them that's the one that a person has to recognize they stay in the same place without doing anything they know that they can change that make that happen. I think that all people in this world has the capacity to do things in life but some of them don't want to do it because they just can't, and they stay there without doing nothing, they should chase that dream and never let it go.. But they can change in like and they can grow up.

As a person we have to respect each other, make decision on life to grow as a person be a good person in the association take care of my and my family respect my family, be respectful with everyone. Be clean be a good person help someone make a man as a person having good attitude be as good person with my mom. We have the ability and the opportunity in our hand.

First , never stay where you are, always try to do something else and try to get more experience, always try to overcome in life,because you can always try to be bigger, and bigger,and try to dominate other things because you have the ability and the opportunity do grow up and never give up easily and if you have the opportunity to grow you will do it because never let opportunity get away from you chase the opportunity to be better and to master other things.

I believe that you always have the ability to chase your dream and if it is not enough you can find more and you can get to your where your limit is. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow,"" I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson, because he says that if you don't do something you will stay in the same place and never grow up if life, you will not advance, and you conformed with what you have. I think that all people have the potential to follow and surpass them abilities and if you already dominated your, you can find and try another one don't stay with the same one because there are always there's a lot of things inside of us that we don't want to take it out of them but if a person take it out he can do things that non one can believed, because it still inside of them you know that you have capacity for that but you don't want to do it.

all people make them own decision but some of them don't know what's them capacity is. I think

I think that respect is one of the most important part in the world.

conclusion

In conclusion I think that all people can always finds more opportunity and they can get more experience by doings new things and overcome a new person in life, and chase dream because if they chase that dream they can make it happen for real. If we make be thinking in this life we ave not gonna grow as a person if we are doing something that we are not suppose to. because you always can be better in life",0
"In my experiences be disagree with this statement because everybody have different personalitie, The person have one day bad, and the persona change.

however the first impressions can be change, Everybody have different personalitie becuase the people make much caracterist tha see different for example a person can have much cualidad that other people don't have, Also do not always other person have that be yourself.

The person have one day bad becuase something the people in the school can have stressful for example when have so much homework during in class , also the person in the job is possible that have problem for example the other person can cause conflict and making is mad.

However the people change becuase they can have a good expression of a manner that your attitude can be esplendi,

for example no every person have bad comportamient.

In conclusion every one can be different personalitie and not is imposible change our impressions have that be we yourself.",0
"It could help humans have a battler life, also you could protect your eyes form getting glasses. Did you just found out?                                                                                          . But technology cost a lot of money. Like if you keep using you phone and not study for a quiz or a test you going to get a bad grade for it. Finding out the time and also the mind reason of technology is calling your family members and also you friends that live in a different country. We should stop using technology for fun. One of my friend cheated on a test with his phone come on, the teacher was just seating on his chair and playing on his phone. Mostly I play soccer. One of my best friend had glasses wend he was only 5 year old. But my option is that technology does not helps you on any thing. Half or more humans use there technology for social media instead talking to them in person. This is why technology bad for everyone. He was watching TV in front of the screen

Technology can help us in a way like sending pictures to someone that live far away form you, Doing your homework. OK lets get to the point am I the only one that know about this? Thie things happen everyday, everywere. But, me i play soccer, baseball and even basketball some times. Technology just routines you brain cell.

Technology can also make a dumb guy. Even one of my best teacher was using his phone to.

Not most of my teacher are this, but some are. If If you use technology if going to eat your brain cell. Ya

I am talking about students so, even gym teacher do it to. Even in gym people just play on there phone and just sit there. Most websites on the Internet shows that humans that keeps using there technology for along time goes through out depression",0
"We used to have two days out of school,but now we are going to have three,so if we add the days like early dismissal,vacations,or because of the weather those are going to be lost days,in fact we are going to lost more days,so I think that is going to affect our academic life. We also know the sun is an energy reproducer and we can get a natural energy,the type of machine that is used for that kind of energy is a little expensive,but is better than a normal energy that we use every single day, it is less dangerous for our enviroment. Energy is something indispensable in our life,so if we do not take care of that resource we are going to have a lot of problems in the future,as energy become more expensive or something like that. The good thing is that we are going to have one more day off out of school. I thing that can help us to reduce the lost of energy,but at the end we make the change. Those are my thoughts,so we can help our world being more educated with our enviroment and the resources that they provide for us. We are teens,we just want to have a good adolescense. Not all of the people are able or agree to work till late,and if they accept they want to be paid more.

Having a long days of school,I mean more hours that we used to do can be stressful for students that are very mischievous or rude,they just want to go home early as they can and if the school add more hours they are going to be more rude than they are. We can provide huge things to our country and the world if we want.. Conserve and earn energy is a big challenge for all,we thought that little things like leave the lights turn on for along time and do not use them is a loose of energy and money,those little things affect us believe it or not and of course affects our aconomy. All of those resources complement each other to do their functions for example: without water we would not have energy,water helps to make energy when it is coming down like a waterfall,so there is when water produce energy. We can start doing little things like turning off the lights of our house when we do not stay there,or when we do not use them. Energy and many different resources are a big patrimony that nature gave us,every single person need to take care of every single resource that we have like energy,water,etc. An example of sunlight energy can be the calculators that need to be charged with light,so they do not need batteries which is a good one.

The government and obviously every single person need take care of this amazing resource to conserve it for a long time. We usually go to school an average of seven hours,if the businessses want to add two or three more hours to be in total ten hours taking out one day,and becoming just four days of school each day ten hours of work,In my opinion is going to be the same,because the two or three extra hours that they would add is the same that one more day of school;however,what is going to happen with the students that are in sports,have other activities or students that are in clubs,they will going home till night,I believe that is not good for anybody,they are not going to have time to do their homework for the next day,or an extra activity if they want during the rest of the day.

In conclusion let the things stay same till this day,we can conserve energy doing other type of proposal that not affect too much the people and their activities. In fact,all in the world has advantages and disadvantages as I mentioned.

One of the advantages that I can see is that teenagers are going to be more hours doing good things being in the school,and not waisting their time doing things that are disturbing for them. I believe the change is going to be stressful for many parents who both of them need to work. One example can be when people who need a babysitter to take care of their children,we know that person also have a family or have things to do after job and if her job take more time that she usually do is going to affect her. The period of time that we used to have to finish the unity for each class sometimes does not adjust and we get busy,imagine if we just have four days of school plus the teens that like to be absent. Energy is one of the most expensive resources,we pay for electricity,because to reproduce energy it goes through an expensive process.

The prompt says that adopt a four days of work with each day consisting of ten hours it is going to conserve more energy. I think ten hours of school is not going to make a big difference,first of all that change will create many conflicts with students who practice a sport,have things to do after school,or need to work after school the time is not going to adjust.

Parents will get in troubles to pick their children or to leave them in an extracurricular activities,even if the school adopt that proposal that does not mean that all of the jobs and schools are also going to adopt it,so that is going to affect families who have children in that school",0
"So there was students how was older then me and the help me where was my classroom because i was getting losed in school and every time when i was getting in to boy bathroom there were showed me where was girl bathroom and they were helped me how to speak English.

The older students are available to assist the younger students by the older students give a advise to the younger, to help them make more understandable on the subject, and to show the the younger how to do something. Many people think that older students can be helpful to the younger students on the other hand many people think that the older student can not be helpful to the younger students by the older students give a advise to the younger, to help them make more understandable on the subject, and to show the the younger how to do something.

The first reason is the older students give a advise to the younger students, the older student are helping with the younger students because when the older student are giving advise to the younger student make them intelligent for example when i was in elementary school in fifth grade my principle asked my teacher to give information or to give idea to the third grader on their project and my teacher sand us to the third grade classroom and my classmate was helping with the third graders.

The second reason is to help them make more understandable on their subject, the older students are trying to make the younger students more knowledgeable in their subject. . when i came to America i was in third grade i was new and i didn'et know what are the school rules and i didn'et know any thing about school and also i did'net know how to speak English. to ilistued. for example when i was in sixth grade the my best friend was in seventh grade when i needed help with my homework or with same other classes homework and she was always helped me with my homework, testes, and quizzes and i was getting more understandable in my every subjects and she teached me how to solved problems.

Finally to shows the younger s how to do something, older student can be helpful when you need help they can help you",0
"So they assist someone.

So the schools created these things to help other students if they are having troubles with there grades, their classes, assist the students get there grades up so they can get better and better. But they studied so hard to get a good grade. They help each others for reasons to get a good grade. . They can get a school a chance make new friends get better in school and then they could help other students to get good grades this is a good program for the other students. For some people it could be easy for the others really hard whether it's elementary, middle , high school thats hard getting ti know the school. They should be able to work with each other they can do this program so that the schools have new students. Everyone had some hard time getting used to the school being shy in all, they get the other older students to assist the younger ones. Programs that pairs older with younger, some younger kids gets used to a new school thats hard for them, if they have trouble in classes. the older and younger kids could be able to work with each others.

It's hard getting used to a new school for other people seeing new people,new classes getting to know other people,making new friends, and everyone gives time for the school. Say we get a bad grade and they try so hard to get the perfected score. Its good that each schools are doing this to help pther students. If new students are having difficult time in this school,classes,people then they should send someone to help them out a little",0
"All student should be ably to use there phones in their free time & in lunch. Kids should start see how it work with the phones in high school. we should all look at this there some good things about having this rule and yes there some bad ones too. Not all kids have phones so to make it far for everyone the rule should be phones and ipods only in there free time .Think this would work good as a rule but we need to try it first. But i think this would work as a good rule for the school.. There some student who don't like to go to lunch or like to eat and by using there phone they have something to do. But not everyone is going to think how i do but i think we should try it for a week or two to see if it works. For some student it will work good but for some it wont. In high school you can use it so why not middle school. Some will have hard time with it but other wont. They should be turn off or it should be low. Most kids use there phone in school when the teacher don't look so its better to have the rule about only in free time. Maybe is not a bad idea doing this new rule about the cell phones. Some student would really like this idea about using phones in there free time. Dear principal

I think that we should have policy number one. That what most kids like and want to be ably to use there phone in school. Because if we don't then the student wouldn't learn. By having this rule i think it will make kids be better because if there not then they will not be ably to use there phones. The teacher get mad when there standing up by having there phone i don't think they will be. So they can have in idea about it. Its better to have them off in class time. But we can say at least we tried. Most student do there homework when there testing and do good in there class. But think that policy number one is a good one and a good idea.

We never now if we don't try. We should try if it work we keep it if it doesn't then we just say it didn't",0
"Some other kids will even sneak glance at bag or pockects or enven in their bagpack. Some students will try to steal their hone back on their own so their parents don't find out at what happen at school. Teachers will even get the student with their phones out red handed. But some use it to look for answers to cheat on a test or text some of their friends for answers. Other students try to hide them so no other tescher can't see them. Some kid will the others students attention to what the kid is doing. It's true that some schools allow student to their cell phones for educational purposes. The parents will have to go the school to pick up there childs phone. Why some the teachers let it happen well they sometimes don't know that is happening.

Students who take out their phones right in the open wil get caught easy. Even with their phones out students barely pay attention in class or at were there going.

Some parents will even get some complains form the school that their kids had their phones out. The parents will tell their kids that not to do it agianbut we all know waht will happen.. Some student who use their phones always get sidetrack for dumb reassons",0
"After he got a driver's license, he can drive anywhere. But Generic_Name thought, ""If I am not gonna take the driving lesson anymore, I can't go far anywhere."" So, he didn't give up and took the driving lesson. She realized, ""If I give up, I can't do something later."" So, she is doing hard for her job, scientist.

When you give up, it will be hard to succeed, and get the benefit.. So, she wants to give up, and get another job that can do easy way. But, there are many hard science problems, and experiment materials. She studied hard, and researched how to succeed in the experiment. After she did that, she got a job scientist. He drives very well after he took the driving lesson.

Another example, Generic_Name wants to be a scientist. Also, she is doing lab with the experiment materials in the laboratory. Because he didn't give up to write a statement. After that, he got a driver's license. So, she didn't give up to be a scientist. For example, Generic_Name wanted to give up for the driving lesson. Ralph Waldo Emerson is the author. But, she decided to don't give up for her job. So, she is studying a science. He wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" I agree with his statement",0
"It should be a good idea for students to know themselves and what they like, because it is unpleasant when a person have to study what the parents want him or her to study just because they could not have done what they wanted to do. So, it is a good idea to commit to a career at a young age.

Based on that, students will have time to prepare themselves to be ready for the career they choose. It might not be noticeable for people the fact that nothing is how it seems, some careers might seem to be easy and be hard, or the opposit, the career might seem to be hard and be really easy. Therefore, many societies around the world, are expect to provide help to the students to find the career they want to study by the time they enter high school. Once again, if students have the school's support, they will be able to find the perfect career for them.

In addition, students will learn about the career and how it works. Schools should require an essay in which students can write about what they like and what skills they have.

So, students should know what they want and what they are good in. In many cases, people that had to choose a wrong career have to deal with a unhappy life, because they do not feel well in their jobs. If students learn about the career they want they will have the opportunity to be great professionals. If students choose their career at a young age, they will be more prepare and have better results while complete their life goals, because life goals are very importat to have a good life's quality.

Also, students will be able to see if they like the career they choose. In my 19 years in this world, I learned that nothing is as easy as we want it to be, but if we search information about what we want to do for life, we will be happier, that is a fact. In addition, many schools think that the students should be young when they think about the career they want, just to make sure that they will not change their minds in the future. Many people have been told about the fact that the students should know the career they want in high school and learn about it. If students are prepare at a young age for the career they want, then they will be able to enjoy it. In conclusion, it is a great idea for students to commit to a career at a young age by the time they enter high school.. Students will be able to make sure that the career they choose is good for them. If the students start learning about the career they want at a young age, then they will have plenty of time to prepare themselves mental and phisically for their future career. For example, it is easy to judge a lawyer when he do not win a case, but we have no idea how hard the work he did can be. Also, students will be able to see if they like the career they choose so they do not regret it in the future. For example, I want to study interior design, therefore, I have to take art classes to learn about colors and how to combine them. So if the schools support students to find the perfect career for them, then this disagreeable situation will stop. In fact, many schools select the courses for the students based on the career the students choose. And last but not least, students will have time to learn how the careers work, so they will have many ideas of how to complete them",0
My other idea is that i think the schools around that county should have a essay in all schools asking students about how they feel about this decision. I also think this because students spent 8hrs in school more than what they spend at home. This is my prompt to yall about if i agree or disagree.. Also the school should be thinking about the students benefits of being in school for longer and for less not just to one side. I disagree with the school board because we not trying be in school more time in school. That would help them with the decision and knowing what would be the impact on the students. The county should take the students decision as a answer about what they think because our ideas matter too. Also students need to have their own time outside of school with family and friends. I think if they did that they point of view will change a lot knowing what students think also it would help them know about what students they are dealing with that would be a great advantage for them,0
"83% of people say that the idea of extending the school day by two hours is a bad plan, For those who dont know the average school day is abut 8:00 am -2:45 pm. The time that students get out of school should not change because the changing of the time would case cognitive impairment and students not having inf time for their jobs after school.

The idea of extending the school day would case cognitive impairment, For example, When my friend got sleepy for doing a school project late last Kite he would constantly forget he had homework and always feel uninterested in doing stuff, When I got tired I have forgotten to check the time that I had to get to work.

The plan would case students not having inf time for their jobs after school. It would be best to not to change are present schools start times and end times.. However it still dose not address that facts that people well not retain much memory of what they lend do to long school hour, and not having inf time of finding a job. For instance, When I had to stay after school for a test I had to miss work, and my manager had to cut my pay for messing work, Because i had to stay after school I lost my chains to get paid for my hard work.

Some people say that the plane would give students a four-day week than are five-day week",0
"Job oppurtunity's will help you out to save money, working on what you like doing and also find some jobs can help you get into college if you are interested. My plans are to continue working on cars and hopefully find a job at a dealership so I can learn enough at college.

Another reason on why I feel like allowing students to graduate in three years instead of four is so that they can start off there future earlier than others by attending college. Some school districts offer programs that allow high students to gradute in three years instead of the traditional four years. Some students are already looking somewhere to move on there own or with a roomate because they might be having problems at home that they don't want to deal with. For example, paying bills, paying rent, house supplies and also if you have a vehicle make sure that your payments are on time.

In conclusion, I feel like allowing high school students to graute in three years instead of the traditional four years is a good idea. In my opinion, I feel like it is a good idea for some school districts to allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years.

The reason on why I feel like it is a good idea for students to graduate early is for Job oppurtunity, Entering college early and also Moving other places and starting a whole new life without no worries on education no more. Job oppurtunity, Entering college early and also Moving to another state or country in my opinion are one of the main important things to focus on after finishing high school.. Entering college early is a good thing because you have some time to pick and decide on what you might want to study and learn about so you can get your masters on it or so that you can finish early and move onto what's next on your accomplishments in life. For example, I am studying about autotechnology and it is my second year doing it. At the same time of moving to another place you have to make sure that you are ready on what's about to come into your life. Starting a new life moving somewhere else means finding a better job oppurtunity, finding a olace to live in your budjet and also finding new people to hang around with but in my opinion at the end it will all be worth it. My school has the option to do Dual Enrollment which basically means starting college already and getting already college credits and still having to be in high school.

Finally, another reason on why I feel like graduating high school earlier than others is to have the chance to move to another country or state and start a brand new. Starting a brand new life can become very hard and very stressful",0
"One reason is my friend Generic_Name, who finish high school early, and now he's done with college; Additional,

he says that finish high school is very good because he got more time to work but not everyone think like him.

Therefor my others friends who think that is not good, because they need go prepared to the college, so they says if I finish early high school I can't go prepared to the college; Another reason is that no body want lost time, for that reason my friend Generic_Name finish high school early, but many youngest are lazy.

Every school need offer that program, the program is really important because can help a lot students to finish high school early; Also, a lot student want finish early.

I think that everyone need take the program, because the students got more time to work, and to learn too, so the program is a big help for the students who take it. One year is a long time, in one year early they can got more money and more everything.. My friend Generic_Name ad others friends who I know, they are benefit. I think that finish high school in three year is a really good idea, because I can go early to the college, and I don't lost time",0
"What i mean by this is that the older student will help the student on math, language arts, and science which the older student already took. The younger student might ask for help on his homework and the older student will help him. This is why the program is helpful. The young student might even study algebra with the older student. The older kid already knows the concepts of the subjects that the younger student is taking, which means he will teach him the concepts. This program can make your child be more smarter, be prepared for whats coming in the future, and a older student can help the younger student with his/or her homework. For example, the older student can teach the concepts of algebra which the younger student is taking next year. Do you want your kid to be assisted by a older student? Well look no further, this program could make your child be more smarter, prepare the young student for whats coming in the future, and a older student can help the younger student with his/or her homework.

The older student that is assisting the younger student could make him smarter. The older student can teach what he is learning to the younger student. The older student can teach other subjects like physical science, and civics economics which the young student could be ready for.

The final reason why this program is helpful is because the older student helps the younger student with his homework. This means that the younger student would already know the concepts of the three subjects that the older student taught him which is science, language arts, and math.

The older student can prepare the younger student for the future. If the student does not understand the question then the older student would teach him.

This program is actually pretty good for your child if he does not understand and need help on a subject that he has trouble on.                      ",0
"For example when i came to America I thought my life was over learning a whole different language and also trying to adapt to whole new country a whole different environment would be hard for me. We all have them phase that we go through and we feel like we cant keep moving forward but why stand in the same place with that same negative attitude is going to prevent you from wanting or doing more. For example, when it comes to school, significant others and obstacles that life may throw at us. We all go through so much and the only way to get through is having a positive attitude that things well turn out better than yesterday.

Others would say that you dont have to have a positive attitude in life to be successful because they probably dont have self confidence, someone around to give them hope or have giving up on their self to many times. Instead of being hard head i stayed positive learn English really fast and started to start feeling more comfortable in America. Is important to not loose our cool and have the type of attitude that everything is going to turn out great at the end of the day.

Having a positive attitude when it come to school can be a way to cope with all your assignments, teachers and schoolmates. I also was thinking of families back home and how i cant let them down, because they would love an opportunity like this to have a free education and being able to make it to the 12 grade. I agree that having a positive attitude is the key to being successful in life. Now we must pass SOLs to graduate but, a person who stays positive believes in there self makes it easy for their self to get through what's stop you from being happy.

Everyone in life have to deal with different types of obstacles physically and mentally. Especially being a teenager people thing is not difficult to wake up every morning 6 or 7 AM and deal with people's attitude and also having to worry about the amount of work the teachers give out to students and then going home to do chorus is something that teenager are capable of doing, but adults don't take that time to think that they was teens back in the 60s where life isn't easy but when it comes to school rules have change. I believe is important to have a positive attitude because having a positive attitude can open doors to different phase in life. I believe that having a positive attitude is the key to being successful in life because you viewing life on a whole other level all you see is good things coming your way and the nothing can get in between of your dreams and if you was to fall you going to pick yourself right back up and start again.

In conclusion being able to wake up every morning and thank God for another day and pray that things are going to turn out better than yesterday is an important skill to have in this world we call life.           ",0
"or watching you favorite show in YouTube, Netflix or whatever other app that you use is positive way of use the technology.

But you know in the worth nothing is perfect,like my grandfather used to say ""there has to be bad things, so that there could be good things"". I always preferred to be with my cousin, and my childhood friends then be in my house talking about boring things, but now you can not have simple conversation with some people because when you are talking to them most of the time they are in they phone doing who knows what, and I don't know about you. technology has made every more easier, you can do almost anything, you can shopping without leave your house, order food...

and all this stuff made people lazy, maybe they ask thyself why should I do this when my small phone or computer can do it for me, why should I date someone to talk to them when I can do it by my phone, why should I have to have a conversation with somebody when there is a whole lot of thing that I can do in my phone or competed. but to me that's a disreperfull way to tell me that you don't care about what i'm saying, and that could made people dislike you.

technology is one of the greatest things ever invented, it made more easier the communication, it give entertainment to the people, it inform us of every that is happening in the worth, even in the space, and we don't have to read a whole book to find answer. It depend on the person, that's what I believe.

It has a positive effects in the way that it can help people that feel along entertain thyself without nobody, I don't think that there are many things nothing worst then feel along. Mar/14/2019

Has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on people's lives?

And many ways I think it does, and in others I think it doesn't. and I had seen many people who prefer all those things before then be along, and checking out book, shopping, playing games, listening music in your favorite app, Pandora... And maybe you are going to keep asking the same question to yourself unto the day that there would be no body by your side.

In Conclusion the technology is something very good, if you use it just when you need it. every positive thing has to have it on negative thing.

it has a negative effect on people lives because with the advice of the technology phone, and others the people are losing the interest in norma things, like some people don't even care about family reunion. not letting it get into your mind. that can do bad things to people brains, and I am not saying that there is nothing worst, I mean be in prison, not had a job, die...

Your body needs movement or some type of exercise. My thought on the prompt are that I think it's better to be active. Like a personal trainer or a coach.

Inactivity is sometimes bad especially if you do it for a long time. It can be frustrating to other people if everybody is working but you and they need your assistance. Many people enjoy or like to be active and it makes them feel good including myself. You can'not be jumping and running all over the place you are going to get kicked out. For example, if you are watching a movie at the movie theater. Doing something all the time can make you physically fit. If I'am inactive for a long period of time i can get sick or really anybody if you have been laying around doing nothing for days. You can be moving all the time and a lot it can be good exercise.

I like working out or helping people out especially my family. You do accomplish more if you stay active and you can meat your goals in life if you put hard work and not staying idle.. I can'not stay inactive for a long period of time like many people in this world. That's why it's better to be active.

Therefore, inactivity can sometimes be good or necessary. You can be very helpful by helping people out or doing chores",0
"with your's adults, we need to follower the rulers.

Secondly, character traits such as can be kindess chose, for exemplo my friend this morning and last nigth, they both asked can other for things and instead for of becaing a horrible person. . Firstly, I think the politics a good thing.

However some people feel that requiring, I belive a person can change traits, aslo has a great politic, so many people wants to be a good person, but maximun of the people are good and bad. With your mom, dad , brother, teacher, friends, grandmother. So we need to be a good peron every time. dont forwet the rulers, be friendly, the love alweys with you. also when we have the opportunitly to help peple,

Afther that, so many people are rude, bute we need to be humbly every time, also we can demonstrate humbly, when we go in the bus sad hi or good morning, also in the morning when we get up sad good moring to the parents, or every time sad thanks when person give you somthing, and not to be impolite.

conclucion, I belive we can demostrate respect , on my words if we need respect, first we need to respect every people, no ridicule to the another persons, we can stop the bulling to the childrens, and adults peple, also respect every singol day. alway we need to be nice with another persons, we need to be honest, aslo when we have a horrible friends we need to be nice with them",0
"I'm agree because your first impression it will be the one that represent who you are and it will show your personality, and the people will judge you becauseyour aparience and your actitude, for example, when i was looking for a jod at chipotles restaurant for the first time, they where looking at me strange like i was a bad person or a criminal.

The next day i went to popeye's restaurant with different type of clothes, and they didn't look at me in a strange way, and that was because i was dressing properly, and because my friend tell me to dress better because in the first time when i went to chipotle i was dressing as a bad guy and that make me look inapropiate and i did get the job.

After that i went to chipotle restaruant just for fun to prove if my friend was right and he was, the people from chipotle didn't look at me in a strange way as the first time, i think it's because they didn't remember me but when the manager comes he said, ""hoo hellow you're back,"" then he leave.

The manager was the only person who remembers me and he did not change his opinion about me, i didn't care because by that time i did get the job at popeyes so i decide to leave out of there.

In conclution that day i learn that the first impresion metter and it could affect in your life.",0
"When looking you will find a lot teens thinking about their career .The career they want to commit to and some teens do change want they want to be , but still they are committing to it and they can just change if they do not want to do it .For some reasons young teens around the world that are still in middle school are already commit to a career and that is a good thing right most of them are really into it , and they are taking their career far enough .So far like 10,00 teens are most famous because of their career that they are doing now and they take serious because they like and they are good at it mostly middle school teens. People believe in what they want to believe in so I say that commit takes responsible ,but I know that we teenager can change the world and show them that not all teens are the same and keep believing in what career you want to commit to because committing is not an easy thing to do expressly when you are a young teen or kids .I know people say that we can commit to what we want ,but not everyone is good at committing to a career when it comes to young and committing to something that is big than your own head or mind. These days they are unstoppable for what they do sometimes they are good more than adult at committing to career when it comes to what they want to do in life.

Some people might argue that students identify a career by the time they enter high school , because they think some students can not do that when it comes to committing to career they think that young teens can not do it .Because technology has taken the mind of teens .They say that teens can not do anything because all they think about is technology and all the things they do they always use technology so some people do not believe that teens these day can commit to anything i .Many people believe that it is hard for teens to commit ,because they can not take responsible of what they do and some think that they are so imature .When it comes to committing to career the parents thinks it how they act at home that why they can not commit to career and some thinks it how they behavior when they are in school .Some people believe that teens can not commit to a career ,because they do not know what to do and some thinks that young teens can not do it because they changes their mind most of their time on settling on what they want to do .Bunch of people believe that teenager can not do it because they quite so early and so easily anyway a lot people do say that can can not be a good generation because they do not know what to do.

But it doe not mean that all teenager are bad some might change when they grow up and some might not change ,because they just do not want to change consoling the thing they might have gone through so for these people. Students committing to a career when they about to enter high school is by far a great idea. When middle school students start taking these class students think only about passing so that they can not repeat that class and some just want to pass the class but mostly it about passing the class so that they can be able to get credit, and that leads to taking the class the will help that person career or what kind of career they are into. When kids are still in elementary they can say what they want to be, but they can not choose the class for the specific reason because they are still kids. Elementary students have 4 years where they take class that are chosen for them in the 4 years they study just to get good grade ,but they do not think about choosing the class for themselves .But when it comes to 5th grade they still study the class that are chosen for them except that when they start to think what if I could choose the class that I want to study for my career or what kind job I am going to study to be able to get that job and that how they start committing to a career .when it comes to elementary school students.

Middle school students are commit to career because they are teens and they have to think about a lot of things that they want to do personally when it comes to career or what they want to be when they grow up that when they start .Committing to career start in elementary , but mostly it begins for real in middle school because that when young teens start taking class like algebra,earth science,biology ,world history, etc . But when it comes to middle school students they can choose what class they want to take for a specific career they have in mind .

Student can commit to a career when they enter high school , but they do that when the student already know what they want to be or what they want to do by the time they enter high school so the student at they would be committing to what the student want to do so the person doing so chooses the class the person want to study . Students committing to a career is a great idea when you really want to do it .

Committing to career

When elementary students are in 5th grade they start carefully thinking about what they are gonna do,

because when they are in 5th grade it their last year in elementary school so they have to think about what they want to do. From elementary to middle school students are allowed to choose what they want to study toward a specific career or what they want to be. So keep believing in what you want to commit to because once you found it I know for sure whatever it is you will success ,because we you teens work hard for our dream.. When they enter middle school and that when students from elementary school start thinking about their choice and taking their career choice serious ,because that when they start thinking what they want to do in the near future. Who believe that some teens can not commit might be wrong because people change teenager hood do change as well

.

For these who believe in change I as well believe in change people do change and they can commit to what they want to commit to as well as job, career,family or love",0

"Example: I come from of a little country in Latino America. it is wonderful how may be done if we always doing.

Generic_City is a beautiful place but is poor, violent and do not have the sufficient money for live; in Generic_City if you have a car it means that you are rich or you have a good job. For example: I work with my parents in construction and thanks to that I learn many things that I can use for my future.

We can accomplish almost everything. Example if you want to do the best doctor ever, but your parents want you be a famous lawyer; you will strive for be a doctor no matter what.

We will learn the value of the things that our parents do for us",0
"Why we should be agree with have a positive attitude is the key to be success in the life?

because he does what he sets out to do.

When you have a positive attitude you can a good future.

If you have positive attitude and you did something wrong one time, you will try to learn about it, and you will not worry because the next time you will try to emend what you did wrong and you will try to do more better the next time.

This are some reason why we need to have a positive attitude.

They does what they sets out to do.

If your propose is graduate you can do it because you will try to give the best to do it.

My propose was to come to this country and study and study that is what I am doing now, and I say, I want go to The United States many people say why you go to that country, you are so young, other say why you want to study it is more better work and make money, but I don't listen all that wrong thing and I am in this country and I am study too.

If you have propose in your life you can have many thing that other people say that never can have.

When you have a positive attitude, you can have a good future.

If some day you have a accident with you car and after the accident, the car doesn't work and you friend say put the car en the trash and you say not because did you think the car have a little problem and you don""t want to put it in the trash and some day one friend come to check and say the car a little problem maybe you can pay $50 dollar and the car can be like new if you are no positive maybe you put the car on the trash, that is why it is good be positive in your life because if you are negative never you will live so well.

In your life you have to be positive because if you are positive you can have many thing and you can have more friend because some people doesn't like the people who are negative the person who are negative only think on bad thing can hapend or in thing they think that they cant do it.

I don't know the negative person can live if only think on wrong thing can happen and that are so wrong because you never can be have friend to talk because they think something bad can happen or they think that is a bad person.

When you have a positive attitude, If you do something wrong one time, you will try to learn about it and the next time I will try to amend what I did wrong and I will try to give my best for do it more better.

If I fail this SOL I will try to learn about what I did wrong for the next time I will try to give my best again and put in practice what I learn.

If I am doing a work and when i am doing I do something wrong I will try to n and when I have to do it more better next time.

If you are doing a project and you forgot write something you will try to learn and next time you will try to doesn't have any wrong.

I am agree with said that positive attitude is the key to success in life because If you have one propose you can do it.

your future can be successful. when you do something wrong in you life you try to learn about it and next time put on practice what you learn, amend what I did wrong and do it more better.

"It helps them further there knowledge and can possibly get a better job. It makes them feel happy knowing they can finish school because they know they already making a decision by dropping out but they can still graduate by taking online classes. Most of the students who are dropping out are for financial reasons like, they want to help there family so, they drop out and start working or some teens get pregnant at a young age and there parents most likely they dont support them or help them in anything that they need so, it causes them to drop out. If you are having problems talk to your counselor and ask for a possibility for online classes or your parents if you can get home schooled.

Secondly, it benefits the students who are dropping out of school. You can take your classes when ever you are free. Having online classes can help you stay out of trouble or helps you stop what ever you are dealing with. I think getting home schooled is a good benefit for students who have situations at school, for student drop outs, and it's easier and quicker.

The primary reason on why it's a good benefit, it's that it helps you if you have bad situations at school such as you always get into fights with other students, you are getting harassed or bullied, you have problems with your teachers, or you think you're wasting your time and you could be working and getting money. Its proven that getting home schooled its less stressful than regular school. You get to be home and relax wake up when ever you like to, do your classes take brakes if you would like to, too me it sounds amazing!

Some people might say that getting home schooled is bad because if you have any questions you dont have a teacher to ask or a physical teacher to help you understand the topic you are learning about but it's a one on one class. Generic_Name ask him why? he answered ""i wanna help my family out they dont have any money right now"" she gave him an option for online classes he didnt know it was possible to do that and It made him happy.

Finally, getting home schooled is easier and quicker. I remember when i was at student counseling aide and one day a student came to ask me where should he leave his laptop because he was planning to drop out, he looked upset. Her counselor gave her a better option taking online classes because she had very good grades and she wanted her to graduate and have a good future. it's non-stressful comparing to regular school. My friend is home schooled because she use to get bullied a lot so she wanted to drop out, she could'nt deal with it anymore. In conclusion, it's less stressful and help you feel non-pressured while you are taking your online classes. In some schools they offer distant learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Not only it stops the situation but can help you improve and graduating with no problem. Generic_Name is a science teacher at SCHOOL_NAME he said ""88% students are stressed about school because of homework and not having to finish assignments on time"". If you need to take a break, you can and continue when ever you are ready. There's no students just you and your instructor, it helps you focus which i personally think it will help you more comparing sitting in a class room with your friends not paying attention, playing around or not getting work done. He also said ""only 5% are stressed when they are home schooled"". It also, gives you free time and gives you advantage to do what ever you like. I think it's a good benefit having online classes because it helps with people who have bad situations at school, people who are planning to drop out and its a fast and easier way to get your classes done.",0

"But as i said dont let anyone change who you are, being yourself is good but being alone simultaneously can be a bad thing. And people who are negative all the time can provoke others to be a bad person, which is why they end up all lonely because they fear of others or hate others because they think no one cares about them. But if you got rid of all of that then you would probably live a lonely life in deep and total solitude. Having others in your life is necessary because we can lift each other up, no one is worthless. You are the protagonist of your own life, your life is your own.. In this world not everyone is born complete. Leaving someone on there own can be pretty sad, helping them is what makes you a better person and gives you a better and easy life. Having other people is vital because you get through life more easily, and able to change yourself as you live on. I was only caring for myself most of the time, and when i get back home i would feel depressed and repugnant. Theres a lot of people who think that we live in a society where no one cares about you and doesnt want to help you at all. As time went on i was able to change myself by others around me. However being yourself is always good, but you can also change yourself if you feel the need to. We live in a world where each and everyone of us, will always need someone or others to rely on. When your all alone in your life, you wont have anyone to socialize with you, and keep you company. but thats not true because it isnt there fault, because when you have others with you, it can have an effect positively and negatively. But that all changed later when i realized i needed to have others to help me. But thats not true because all it takes is to change yourself, by having others in your life, or asking for help.

In conclusion individuality can be pretty awful and lead others to a path that is bad. But if someone else were to change you then that would be very bad, because they could be either delusional or emotionally negative of certain things in life. But when you have a lot of friends and get to know other people, you can have an experience with them and its what makes life really entertaining. The world isnt changing you you are changing yourself by just living a life with others around you, and you wouldnt notice that you changed either, but that is a good thing because now you know that if your able to change then anyone should be able to.

The last thing that is bad when you dont have anyone else with you, is that it can be really boring and not fun at all. I have many important people like my mom,dad,sister, and very close friends who are also like family to me. Having other people isnt trivial, you have to have faith in one another to get through life.

There was this one time where i was about twelve to fourteen years old, i would always struggle with my grades in the beginning of the school year, and have a strong sense of unease everyday i go to school because i always felt like wouldnt be able to provoke my self to do better in school and get better at socializing. When your being yourself on my opinion it means you shouldnt have others change the way you are but its up to how you feel about yourself.

I strongly disagree Emerson's statement on how individuality is a good thing, and i have various reasons or examples on this statement. When your with your friends you get to have lots of fun, like play games together, socialize, travel together, and get to have more and more experiences with each other and maybe learn more lessons in life",0

"A student attitude is important because help them to get a better school opportunities. For example: Sports, Science, and others Team's in schools; the good attitude is a requirement if you want to be part of them. People who have a positive attitude do better works. However, students with a good attitude facility they own work, and the teachers work, because if a student have a bad attitude is more difficult that teacher or coach teach them and help as student is good in those things, but have a bad attitude he/she loss the opportunitie to show their capacities.

In conclusion, a positive attitude is the key to success in life, as important and help to people get more opportunities at jobs furthermore be great in studies and get a better communication with all people, that make a success person in their life.. A position of the body or manner of carrying oneself. Do yo prefer a person whit bad attitude or good attitude?, think about it. for example: I am waitress and my boss say all the time "" if you want to be a good customer service you need to have a good attitude"" and thats true because when i have a good attitude with the costumers they give me a good tips, but when i have a bad attitude i get bad tips. Students with a negative attitude have difficulties to connect with the class and work in a group. In some companies a positive attitude is a requirement for the employer. In my position i agree with the statement, because; people get better communication with others, get more jobs, and students have more opportunities.

Some people think attitude reflect self confidence to society, as positive attitude reflect peace and happiness. For example: When i have a positive atittude; i see more people want to know about me , but when i have a bad attitude nobody want to know me, because they know people with a positive attitude reflect more friendly, furthermore people with positive attitude have better relation with their family, friends and communitie as they energy is more pleasant.

A positive person with good attitude get more jobs. Customers want a good service, employer want to make good money and companies want a good workers.

Some Schools want students with positive attitude. A positive attitude is the key to success in life",0
"It will be less likely for one to not complete a task or struggle with a task if is idle. For example my dad once told me, why are you always playing video games and that why dont i go and play outside with my friends. Actively participator have better improved skills then those who dont do anything.

Firstly, being active is the best goal a mind set can have. Inactivity and idleness is not good because by not having anything to do you wont learn as much as a person that has to do majority of time. Going to the Gym doesnt only show that you have an excellent daily routine but you are person that has a goal to complete each and every day. By always having something to do, your showing everyone your character and your morals. Keeping your self occupied thew out any circumstance is a good skill and shows that you are not inactive and that nothing is excluding you from doing anything you have to do.

In conclusion, do you think always having something to do all the time shows who you really are? Participating shows a lot about a person goals and achievements. it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". Humans that are always active rather than being idle and isolated have a better attitude and work experience. Theres no task to difficult or no job to big for you to complete because you are already used of always doing something in your everyday life and while being idle from the task isnt part of your expectation or motives. Likewise, many people belive that "" Determine never to be idle ... Always doing something no matter if you have nothing to do, shows a lot about someones motivation and actions. Later that day my coach was talking to my dad and telling him how i was participating and doing everything he told me to do. What i told him was that i did not want to and he told me that my actions show a lot about who i am. I strongly agree that by being active will get more tasks complete and it will be less difficult. After that he signed me up for a youth soccer team, that i played being a defender. Especially in a work place, if your boss sees you doing nothing while there being things to do, hes going to think your inactive. By all means that by being idle you wont get much done, but if active can get a lot of more stuff done. Although i wasnt good, i started trying my best and being active with the team. By showing everyone you always have something to do, your showing them that you are capable of doing anything. What he also had suggested to my dad was if he can move me up to a left forward because of all the hard work and commitment i had done for the pass warm ups and practice games.

Therefore, people that are always participating you will see improvement in grades, work ethic and body structure. If you think of always being occupied and being successful it practically the same concept just because getting task done is like you doing anything you are asked to do and being successful is like achieving your goals.

Secondly, Idle and inactivity serves a purpose when you are a 100 percent sure you can do anything when asked to. While a person that is consistently doing things and keeping there self occupied and does not tend to complain about what they are ever asked to do. Others belive that by being idle, you can still get anything done as much as a person that is consistently active. Inactive people show their lack of interest and the type of attitude shown. Always doing stuff will make you want to complete more each and every time.. People that always are doing something productive in there everyday life have good grades because they are used of finishing all their work, rather then the student that doesnt do anything and idled from the class",0
"Whatever place we g, we most be honest with all kinds of people no matter what. One action talk a lot of a person because demonstrate that that person know who he is. However;

"Have you seen how long it takes to check out in Walmart! thanks to technology now and days?

Have you ever experienced or seen a cashier take a billion years just to scan the chicken your considering purchasing? i have and It was devastating to watch! or have you witnessed a wrong change? things like this happen way to often and if you never noticed it on your receipt you just lost some money. see it this way, technology helps us so much like buildings cars and airplanes, technology has taken over restaurants in such a way that you no longer have to tip! technology and stores do mix and its just speeding up the process.

Although technology might be taking hundreds of jobs, technology is one of the best things we have in this world. Near my local ford dealer they have a great restaurant where technology is all they utilize.

Who would've known by using technology in restaurants everything would run much smoother, by using technology ordering your favorite meal off a tablet was never this cool. org get the piece you need the next day. Isnt technology just great? through time technology has been advancing, and it's just getting better, but is it minimizing our connections with the human contact? I believe its had a good positive effect on peoples lives. That's why they invented self checkouts to speed up the process of purchasing, thanks to these great machines leaving Walmart was never easier to do. How stressful would it be for Ford Junior to hire millions of workers, and finish one car every five hours? or opening up a restaurant and hire twenty workers who are rude, lazy to there customers? and last but certainly not least, Walmart having hundreds of workers who take forever to scan and pack your items.                                         . Having to buy parts has never been easier thanks to Ford/store. while your enjoying your meal staff members will have a chance to be doing somethings else unless called by a customer. Yes they'll once in a while have some bad performance but most of the time there really reliable. All of this would stink if we wouldn't have such great technology in our hands. Yes that means there would only be a few people employed and less contact with waiters/staff members but there is a good side, no need to worry about tip, especially no human mistakes, order everything off your finger tips. Is it weird not seeing a employee in the cash register? yes but you'll get use to it as time continues.

Having technology in our side has made us better and has lighten our sense of being, technology has been so good to us that it has brought positivists in our lives. Just scan and go! sooner or later every store in America will have these great machines. Ford industry is a great example they make their cars using robotic technology! by using these big instruments they are able to make a car every ten minutes, that's incredible, and not just that they have the capacity to sell trucks without specking to a customer, representative its all online no need of customer service",0
"Think about how I can to my purpose. Is it struggle in the my mind. Life is your what is want to do, do more? or idle for time?       . When you be to purpose, I will wonderful done much to do. Never have idle for life? I think maybe, but I feel is impossible, because you can be idle, this is your life, you can decide idle or completely do something.

I believe doing something you like, you are quick accomplish. sometime you do this thing, and you want to other thing on the same time.

I am a student sometime I have had homework to do. You do anything have had process. What are you doing for a day? Do you accomplish something? Everyday you want do somthing, maybe you are inactive. If I have some problem thing, on the idle time, I can think about find some solution. In the this world everyone have twenty-four hours for one day. Which I want to do first? If I finish my project, after the time, I can to want I want to do ,is purpose for a day.

My position is if I always focus one thing, I will cacccompish more. Determine never to idle? For example; After school, I need thoughtout I have project to do, I want to relax do nothing, and I want to eat dinner. If I am idle, it is waste my time, and I can not to my purpose",0
"Just by watching people play these games makes me want to compete with them. Beating other players with characters I love makes me want to play more with new people. If I can win a tournament and get the money, I could have those things and even get more that I need. I always loved competing with others and now I could even get paid to do so if I win a tournament.

""Super Smash Bros"" just gives me the thrill of competing with others and having fun while doing so. If I can buy those then I won't have to have help from my family. People always get this thrill of winning and it keeps them going to win more. I never really had the best communication skills, but I can enjoy playing different video games and competing in tournaments with others while improving my social skills.

Winning a tournament can help me get money, so I can buy my necessities in life. Smash Bros helped me discover other games to enjoy with others like Kirby franchise and the ""Legend of Zelda"" franchise. In the future, I hope that one day I will win a ""Super Smash Brothers"" tournament. Every time I beat my brother in a game I get excited each time, and I want to beat new people just to get that thrill. Growing up, Smash Bros has always been one of my favorite games as a child and it had helped bring my siblings and I closer together. Winning a tournament or just competing in one will help me learn that doing activities are not always as fun as doing them with others.

My life will be brighter when I accomplish something big like winning a Smash Bros tournament. Even if we've gotten tired of doing other activities together, we've never got tired of fighting each other in the game. Fighting with my siblings had molded me into the competitive person I am today, so because of that I want to fight other people and get something out of it. I know that I can't just win a tournament right off the bat but I want to try, because the thrill of just winning and having fun is what makes people enjoy this game. Getting the money could help me buy luxuries like a house or a car. Winning a ""Super Smash Brothers"" tournament is something that I can enjoy while helping me in life.

""Super Smash Brothers"" had helped me bond closer with my siblings throughout my life. I've always enjoyed the fun in playing games with others and talking to them about it. I learned that doing activities are never as fun when you're doing it alone. Like other games, Smash Bros bring players together by competing with each other and just having fun. It also sounds great when you get paid to do something you love like competing in tournaments. I want to experience that with other people in tournaments. I can get paid for winning a tournament, and it will help me get through in life. ""Super Smash Brothers"" brings others closer together with their families and friends.. I could get other games that I enjoy watching other players play. It helped me learn to be competitive because it's a competition in the real world. If you don't get that thrill of wanting to do more of what you are doing then you wouldn't do that thing again for a while",0
". If a thing come to your life, and you know that, it will have a negative impression on your life try to keep them away, because they can make problems for, they can pretend you from having a good future, they will try to destroy you, so you are the only person who can keep all these things away. Having friends with positive impression in life will help you to take over your problems easily, but if you have friends with negative impressions, they can put their own negative impressions on you too, they will make think like a loser, because they don't want to reach your success.

In my idea those who want to change their first impression, first they have to think why they want to change it, what negative result they have seen with this impression, after they reached the position to change their first impression, they should start working for. In the process of changing this impression they will also learn a lot of new about how much will a positive impression good for them what can a positive impression do for them. Changing the first impression is not impossible for those who have a strong trust on theirselves, and really want to change this, especially, if this impression is negative, because he knows or soon he will know that this can be very bad for him, and can keep him down in school, society, or in the place they live. Everything that you have control of them, and you want to change them, you can do so. He will try to change it to positive impression, which will be hard and for him it will be a strange thing, because he never tried this before, but, as he continues he will realize that, how much he was bad with that negative impression, and how much he was hurt, by that negative impression. They become to change themselves from what they were before, tried to forgot about the negative impressions they had before.

if you Have a negative impression at first, and you want to change it, it will be hard, but it is not impossible, if you really want to change it. Changing this show them that everything that they want to change in their life is up to them, however, it will not be easy to do that, but that doesn't mean that it is impossible. For example; if a boy in a place or society have a negative impression, other people who live in there will not let their children s to play with him, or to go to school together, or even their parents will try to change their children s classes if they know that they are in the same class, because they don't want their children to be like him, or to have a negative impression that he has. As the boy grows up, and recognize that he should change the negative impression that he had at first, which kept him away from his friends or classmates. Most of the peoples want to change their first impression, because they haven't seen any positive result from it; they want to change it for a good future. This kind of people will have a hard time to forgot their first impression. Having a negative impression at first, and changing it will take much time, but changing this will help you to reach where you want, it will help you to achieve your goals, and it will help you to find a good friends, everyone will try to be your friend, and wants to have a good relationship with you, so you not only help yourself, but you will also help your friends to reach their success or to achieve their goals. I'm disagree with this statement, that the first impression is impossible to change, because, I have seen a lot of people who doesn't had a positive impression at first, but later they completely changed. When we try to find new friends we always try to find about their impressions in our life; how can they help us to solve our problems, or how can they help us to achieve our goals. First impression is like the first step toward your goals, so if you have a negative impression it will be almost impossible for you to get there, because having this impression can also effect your lessons, but if you have a positive impression it will be much easier to get there, because you can have more success in your lessons. Everything in your life is in your control, and you are the only person that can change what ever you want to change in your life, it just depends on you, that you are going to handle the situation. They will know that having a positive impression is not in everyone's luck, those who have a positive impression, on their society, school or etc will have a successful future. Those who have negative impression can't reach their success, because having a negative impression is like a wall between you, and your success, that will prevent from you achieving your success. It well be hard, but not impossible. For most of the peoples it will be hard to forgot about their first impression, because they have a good knowledge with that, and they think it is good even if it is a negative impression. It can bring a lot of changes on you it can change you future, your position in a place.

I think that those who want to change their first impression should know that, this will not be easy, but if they try, and keep this in mind, that if they bring this change in their life they actually achieve a very big success. It is not going to be easy, but that doesn't mean that it will be impossible. For most of the people changing their first impression looking impossible, because they are never going to try it, they never want to experience a new thing, or maybe most of them think that this is not that important, but, I think that first impression is also very important in life. First impression can also have a large effect in someone's life, if it is a positive impression it can lead to the success, they want to have, but having a negative impression will not only take away your success, but it will also keep you down in your society, you will not have the respect, that you want have in your society. As, he knows that how much a negative impression will hurt them, they will try to change it",0
"I support that schools should follow the same model as the business model who have adopted a four day work week to conserve energy and resources, energy, and extending the school day two hours, this kind of model could make them feel better to attempt to class, and start taking action about conserving energy and and think about our future there could be a day when our energy and resource comes to a end for humanity if we dont take actions.

However they should considered that energy and resources benefits us and the world, we mostly need energy in everything to survive and resources its a natural source of wealth or revenue that enhances the quality of human life, if businesses have adopted a four day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours to conserve energy and resource for their future, my school should follow this model because i think schools are the most who spend and waste energy and resource by their thousands of students that attempt there.

With a four-day school week , student would at least get rid of depression which adds unnecessary stress, they will have a one break day to do their homework and assignments without staying up all night just to finish it, at the same time it will benefit the environment by just having a four day school week , it will be harder for them to adapt for a longer days of school and a shorter week of school, some of them will not adapt to it but still it would help them to be more time at home with their family instead of be at school stressing.

Whatever, If parents and students got the benefit of having a day off, parent will have the time that they didnt have before with their kids they will more hours of work and school but still it may help them to have a better connections, and at least they would have a day off stressing and worrying about their work and assignments.

In Conclusion, cutting one day out of school would be helpful for young teenagers who are studying and working at the same time to help their families, and it would conserve much energy and resource than before, making our environment greater by conserving energy and resource in only four days of work for adults and four days of school for teenagers who attempt to any school.

"It is incredible knowing a women from a country that does not have much to give is now flying in the air going around the world. Im very happy and thankful that I have this opportunity, and I know I will make it through this school year if I believe in my self.

The other night I was going through my Facebook feed and I stumbled upon a link that one of my friends re-post, on that link there was an article of a women that is from El Salvador, and that women use to live near to where we used to live. My mom packed up her stuff and left with my aunt behind her mothers back, but before she left she left a note for her mother saying if she doesnt leave now they'll never have a better future. My mom knew what she was getting her self into she believed everything would come out fine, the day my aunt was about to leave to Mexico my mother begged her to take her. Before she came to the United States her mother didn't want her to come she thought it was to much of a risk. Years later my grandma got her Visa and was able to come visit, she regretted doubting her and apologized for not believing in her. So, of course I accepted and now I am here taking my writing SOL with my positive attitude! If I didnt have a positive attitude I wouldnt be here right now, and for sure I wouldnt be graduating in May of 2020. On that article it said ""First women Pilot from El Salvador"" when I first read it I could not believe what I was reading, I was very happy for her and I know she worked so hard to get to where she's at. He told me I could do three years but I would have to do two years in one, I didnt care if it would be more work all I was thinking of was graduating on time. She has a better life now then she had before, but she still has more to accomplish and I am here to help her. A few days pasted by and he asked me how I felt being behind the sophomore class, I told him I didnt like it and how I felt a little dumb. That shouldn't bring you down that should be more motivation to do better because those are people who are jealous, people that are jealous of something you have and that they dont have. In the other hand there will be people that dont want too see you do good, people that want to bring you down and people that have envy over you. My mother has walked thousands of miles and has nearly starved to death to get to where she is now. A positive attitude is the key to success all you need is to believe in yourself, have patience, and ignore all the ignorant people. He then asked why I was 16 years old with freshmen classes, I told him why and he understood. If my mom didnt have a positive mind set and if she listened to my grandma she would still be in El Salvador; washing her clothes in the river, eating beans and eggs everyday, and earning six dollars a day. Is a positive attitude key to success? Well, In my opinion I strongly agree, I believe a positive attitude will take you far in life and will let you accomplish many goals you've set for yourself. . A positive attitude is the key to success all you need is to believe in yourself, have patience, and ignore all the ignorant people.

In my experience a positive attitude is a key to success, why? Well, when I was younger I had a difficult time with the English language because I only spoke Spanish at the time, which then resulted that I had to repeat a grade. Positivity allows you to set goals and to accomplish them. There are people who have started from the bottom with very little and are now doing big things, by having a positive mind set and believing in themselves. Reading that article motivated me to set goals for my self and to keep on going, if she can accomplish her dream I can to.

I admire my mother, she's gone through so much and has risked her life to have a better one, not just for her but also for her family that she had to leave behind. He then told me how I would feel about graduating with that class, I then knew what he was about to tell me and I liked the idea of it. With her positively she can go far.

Therefore a positive attitude is the key to success, negativity won't take you anywhere all it does is let you watch others have fun while they enjoy life. Being left behind made me feel dumb and stupid, I also felt embarrassed; embarrassed of saying my age to the other kids when they would ask how old I was, I thought they would make fun of me and call me names. When I met him he asked me many questions one of them was how old I was when I told him he was surprised because I was older then the other students. My aunt would deny and deny her until she finally said yes. Many people have met their goal by believing in them selves, no matter how difficult it is they keep on pushing.

I believe attitude does have an impact on life choices, if you put no effort on a task your set to do, that task will never be done or it'll turn out horribly. She worked her head off trying to make enough money to support her family, she had three jobs and as soon as she clocked out of one she would walk miles to get to the other one. For instance having a positive attitude doesnt just affect you but it also affects others in a negative or positive way, for example motivation; you could motivate someone and inspire them just by doing you and accomplishing youre goals or you could even brighten somebodies day up by doing small gestures. Through out the years I got more mature and I didnt really care no more about my age, I then found out that there were other kids that were in the same situation as me, which made me feel better about myself after.

When I got to high school I met my case manager, he was and still is a really nice guy and really cares about the students",0
"I am trying to get in to a art college, so im going to an art schools for 5 hours to make my paforlio for it. And the classes may have more work to do in class that can lead to more stress to the students and more homework to finish off at home.

Sure when students become an college students and adults they have more thing to do in there schudule then a student in high schools. But student do extra thing to get in to the college they want to get in to. Some of the student may have go to an importent event that has a time on it like a funeral in a diffrent state and that can lead to get behind in class work.

More work may over stress the student mind and they might fall behind in things that might be inmported, the student may have less time to sleep to get work done on time beacuse there schdule maybe get more cramp with work to do, then they were before the school have added one more hour of school day. Disagree about extending the school days two hour long and be a four day school week, the reason I disagree with this event is beacause if the school extend the day 2 hours can mess up the student schedule after school ends. I have art school after schools ends and I need to be there on time to finish part of my art work that help me get in to college. Now lets add two hours for my school I have to reschdule my art school time then after art school I need to eat dinner then do my home work and I have little to no sleep trying to get my homework done in time for the next day.. I'm also making my essay and taking the sat to get into the art college I want to get in. The students may have to reschdule some of the things that may have to do after schools end and some student can't changed there schdule at all also more stress can happen to the students.

Some student have things to do after school like they have a jobs go to after school ends, I have a friend that has a job he go to after school end and to go right away or he will be late for work that can lead to him fired",0
"I believe that changing the school lunch menu would be a good idea, there are reasons why the change of the lunch would be good idea; It can help students who are sick, It can help the students who play in a sport team, it can help those student who abuse eating at home.

First reason: healthier school lunch menu can be good for many students who does fitness and also for those who play in the school sports teams, they need to be healthier, for example soccer players needs to be with good weight, so they can play good in their games, but if they are eating things with a lot grease they would not be on the team, because they are not eating healthy.

Second reason: The change of the school lunch menu can also be good for those students who abuse eating at home, for that I think the healthier lunch menu can be a good idea, because they abuse eating bad thing at home but, they eat healthier at school, that is the second reason why I choose that the healthy lunch menu is a good idea, because the students are eating better than what they eat at their homes.

Third reason: This last reason is to show that the healthy food is better, because it helps students who are with any type of disease whether is a terminal disease or a normal disease, it doesn't matter what kind of disease can be,

it just that eating healthy help them for example, there are many student who are with diabetes sometimes they to bring their lunch from their home, because at school there nothing they can eat, because everything may have grease or sugar on it, and that is the reason why student bring their lunch, because of their disease, so that is why I think healthy food can a good option for the school lunch menu.

In conclusion, the healthier school lunch menu would be a good idea because it will help a lot students in many ways including teachers, students, and all the people who works a the school, I think is a good idea to be healthy not just out of school also inside of the school, we just want to maintain our habits, and that can be good because, we are doing the right thing, and that is my opinion about the school lunch menu, we just want to improve with the school and doing this we will.",0
"All this coming to a close that not all colleges will be acceptable of you only having to do three years of high school. School may not be the best but it can sure give you the best career life.. You get help with your resume's, and just things that prepare you for a good future. An education can get you a job! A job that'll pay you well and something that you know you'll have as a secure job and not having to change every other month or every three months.

For those students who are planning on finishing high school in three years they must have a plan whether or not they plan on still getting into a college. Graduating a year earlier than your other classmates doesn't make you more than them, it doesn't make any student seem smart, it's just them taking the short cut to end school.

I believe it isn't a good idea for students to graduate a year early. I believe that the students who'd want to graduate a year earlier would be the ones who skip class, don't do their work, are always late to school and so on ,but to make it clear I was just referring to the bad influenced kids. I personally think that going straight to the workforce isn't the best option because to be honest, they just end up working in a Chick-fil-A, McDonalds, Burger King and all those jobs that don't even pay well. That's good I'm not saying it's bad, it's just something I wouldn't do. Also colleges may look on your school record and just see the type of person you were and may not accept you. They choose to take courses in the summer than a nice trip to a beach or hang out with some friends. Some school districts have been offering programs that are allowing high school students to graduate a year early instead of the regular four years. The last year of high school is like the guide to the beginning of your new life as an adult with more goals to be accomplished.

Another reason why I dont think it's a good idea for students to just take the ""easy""way out is because some students just do it to end their school life. Some students may not agree with this but senior year just gives you that extra push into making your future better. Some students end up not even going to college, they just go straight into the workforce. I believe that some students may actually do it because they love school that much that they'd want to get a head start with their career. Some students just don't take the school serious but only if they knew that, that's the key for them to open to get to their future.

If I were agree with school districts allowing students to finish school a year early, I'd think about the positive side it has. Senior year is the last little push a high school student gets before starting a new chapter of their life. Also you get more opportunities to get a little taste of a few colleges when they come to the schools. I mean who wouldn't want to graduate a year early right? but in the end it's not even worth it.

I know that school may not be all fun and games but all that education and knowledge sure does take you far in life. Students who are more than prepared should be the ones graduating early. Being one of those students who get to graduate a year early, it literally doesn't make you cool. In my opinion most students who agree with this and actually want to graduate a year early just do it to get school out of their way. For those who don't plan on going to college, they have to have a better plan for them to survive in the real life. Senior year is the ""best"" year as some students say. I say this because senior year just brings more new experiences to your life. Only students who have had perfect attendance and do their work and get good grades should only get that opportunity.

In conclusion, school districts should not allow high school kids to graduate a year early. They have to earn it and demonstrate their hard work. Graduating a year early, just makes you miss all those nice and fun experiences with friends, including the activities the school does that last year. If some of those students still plan on going to college then they should be aware that some colleges may expect four years of high school. High school isn't a race and neither is who has the best things in life because those you earn them by your hard work",0
"when people ask for advice, sometimes seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by seeing if most peoples opinions are the same and its a good advice some opinions maybe better then others , you can also recave better advice from differnt people like your best friend can give you an advice that will help you lot but the other person that you dont really talk to that person doesnt really know how to help you like your best friend does , each opinion can help you with something different like some one may give you advice about a sport you may not need it right now but you could use it later in life so each opinion can help you later in life it may not help you never know , for example if you need advice on how to do better in school or how to get your grades up you would ask a teacher or your friends but someone else can give you bad advice or it doesnt helpe youor on how not to do well in school so its better to ask multiple peolpe then just one because you have a higher chance of getting good advice frome differnt people and you have more to opinions then just asking one persone beacse he may not have th best advice but he will try to help but you have a lower chand you can see wich helpe more and wich dont really dont helpe you would be getting good advice that will sadisfide you, so in my opinion asking multiple people for advice is better is a better chose then just asking one persone.",0
"Although, I am totaly agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson that what him wrote, but somepeople are conform in yours life with they know and have. I agree because I can learn everyday new things in my life also

I can help others how to do something different if I can do that very well.

learn and help that things make my self very proud and don't feel me comform with

I have.

firts is all, I can try and learn to do something different in my life, how I can learn new things. Another example. Nobody can't stop to learn except that person like be conform in life and don't like to grow in your own life. why shoult be don't try somthing else new in my life? If you have already mastered, you will never grow in life. for example. If I can't to resol some problem in mathematic, I need to learn how I can resol that problem for after will be easy to me how to resol that problem, and that why is very importam to learn everyday somethig different or new in life.

secod is all, in life very important to learn and try to help others because not body kwon when will be need help. I don't like to be conform I like to learn something everyday and help others that my self wil be proud. everybody for reason of life need to learn somenting and help others.. I like to learn and try to help others how to do something new for them. For me it's very importan to learn something differerent everyday in my life. If I am cashear in my job and don't have any idea how to charge some extra price in one orden thefood, I need to ask my manager how I can do. for example, if I know how to ride bicycle, and one person aks me you can ride bicycle and that person need help to learn how to ride bicycle, of corse I can teacher how to ride bicycle or somebody want to know how to use computer I can teacher that and aditional help others that I learned make me feel every good in life.

In conclusion, learn everyday in life is importan and don't stop to do something different also are importan, that why Ilike to learning something new in my life and them help others how to do the I know and learned, that why Iam totaly agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson",0
"In elementary school, I learned about mathematics from addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It was scary at first, but overtime, I've been continually practicing using these tools, and now I'm an expert at using these equipments. Some people think that when they master at something they've never mastered at, then they will grow up. Then they achieve at it, then they will start talking. However, to remedy that, if people continue practicing at something challenging, there is a higher chance that they will achieve at it. Back then, it was a little tough at first, but I kept practicing, and now I can excel at this.

In contrast of Emerson's quote, if people keep practicing, but they don't seem to achieve it, it might make them feel upset and defeated. A similar experience I had was when I was starting Automotive Technology was when I learned about how to operate tools like wrenches, ratchets, how to lift up and carry things like tires, how to use safety equipment, and how to operate electric tools like machines, impact guns, and drills. It will certainly make people joyful that they achieved it.

As Emerson said in his quote, if you try your best or master at something you've never excelled at, then you will grow up and feel joyful about it. From that point on, they will grow into toddlers where they will learn about letters, numbers, how to share with others, and some easy words to pronounce. I continue to eat a lot and I will eat more in my future. I can do these chores without having a family member like my mom asking me to do it.

Another reason why Emerson's quote is correct is because if you continue practicing at something you've neve excelled at, you excel at it, then you will continue mastering at it. That is what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson said in his quote. It will make people happy that they achieved at it. Back then, I used to eat a lot, and that is still true today. My family was impressed at how much I've eatan. By continually practicing, you will most likely achieve at it.. Upon growing into teenagers, they will learn about harder math skills like harder math, reading, and they will even apply for a job. When they grow into 10th graders, they will learn about business, marketing, and learning to drive. Another experience I had was in elementary school. Another experience I had was when I was doing chores like cleaning, vacuuming, washing the dishes, and taking out the trash. A similar experience I had was when I was in my elementary school years when I was eating dinner with my family. ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.

An example of this statement are babies starting to walk. As a result, I grew so much that I was taller than most of my family members, and it's still true today. I would finish almost everything from meat, soup, etc. When they get to kindergarten, they will learn about math, reading, and writing",0
"Finally you simply like school you like seeing friends in school and you like learning more things.

How you may be able to stop it? will first you have to go to your principle and him/her how you can you stop this form going on well they might say get a exact amount of people to sign a paper. However think what is going to happen if i do it so think what your going to do before you do it. What if your school wanted to add one hours and a half would you agree or disagree? I presently think that no one would like that like dont like that idea at all and let me tell you why I would int like that. If it's happening but you dont want it to happen then stop it. First you know you got to go to you best friends and people that dont really like to stay in school that long. Most likely be that people will get tired really fast. First if you dont like school that much like me you would do what ever you can to stop that. If a lot of people agrees you might get this to happen in you school. Finally not that much people would come to school they would not like it even more.

Some ways you might like this is that. If you want it to happen in your school then do it. You learn a lot more thing for next year which is really help full for the next year of classes you have. Well then if they ask you to do that then you know that you have to ask every one in the school to sign the paper if you really don't want this to happen. If you want this to happen then ask your principal if this can happen in any way. Another thing that they can do is add lease day to the school year I think that people would really like that and other ways are. However if it's not that much people yet you know you have to go to every one in the school asking them if they dont want a hours and a half to be added and at the end of that i might have the number you need of people.

Do you want this to happen at your school but your school isnt do it? Well like the other one go to your principle and ask them if they can add another hour and a half but and another day to your week end or less day of the school year. They might add a day to the week end which would be more days per week end that sounds good to me. However there is going to be some one to not like you idea and they might go wrong for you but I think you can get this.

So now that you know how to do this it say do it.    . See if other student want to join you if they want less day of the school year or a another day addend to the week end like a Monday because every hates Mondays right",0
"everyone needs to relax and sleep enough during the day to focus more and do more good at school.

Finally, ten hours is too much for a kid to spend in a day at the school. should the school extend the school day two hours and four-day a week?

people have different opinion about being ten hours in the school day. However, I believe that being ten hours in the school day it is not a good idea, because it dose not help for the energy and the resources, everyone's brain needs to take a break in the day and ten hours working in the school day is too much for a kid.

First, being ten hours in the school day dose not help in the energy and the resources; Because we spend the same amount of time at the school, But instead of spending an eight hours a day in five-day a week we will spend ten hours a day in four-day a week.                         . extend the school day two hours a day in four-day a week is not a good idea because it dose not help to conserve energy and the resources, everyone's brain needs to take a break in the day and ten hours working in the school day is too much for a kid. so what we can do is not extend the school day two hours a day, so all the kids can do good at the school, focus more and live their life happy. so we are going to spend the same amount of energy in both.

Second, everyone's brain needs to a break. for example when my sister stay a little longer after school for extra work, she comes back home so tired, not talking to anyone and doing noting, because she is tired of being a little bit longer at the school.

In conclusion, as you have read. some people think it is a good idea for their kids to be ten hours at the school day. kids will dislike going to school. If we spent ten hours of our day at the school we are not going to be having that much time to live our lives, do our work and see our family. they will get tired",0
"Some people like to stay inside, not get a job, dropout of school, and fisk of having a unhealty body.

Being out of contact of the world is bad, and it very unhealthy to do that.

Next is being active. Being active and getting goals accomplished is good in life.

Having to participate in a activity will do good in life. As Jefferson said ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much mat be dine if we are always doing"".

There will always be different opinions on being active and inactive but not everyone is the same in the world.. People can pursue new learning skills in school or universities. Taking time out of the day to go accomplish anything that people are interested in is a good idea. Just being inactive is bad in general but people do have opinions on about it. It serves a purpose, and it benefits a lot in life like: maybe healthy body, pursing career goals, school goals, and helping others. Getting a job is good example of being active. Thomas Jefferson once said, ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Being active like career goals and helping others and being inactive can lead to alot of health proplems.

Do people accomplish more if there pursuing their own interest, or just being inactive also accomplish goals also?

Being inactive can lead to health benefits, and also your not helping yourself in life, also there is no purpose. If not being active can lead to an unsuccessful life",0
"They would be a lot of students who wouldn't agree with me because of this reason.

Changing school policy isn't a great idea, but to make the students get good grades and to benefit their lives, in that case then it would be good idea. If kids try their best on the subject and still don't get a grade B average, this wouldn't be fair to them. Not every students will agree with me but that's the best way to get them educated even though it wouldn't be fair.

sincerely yours,

STUDENT_NAME. If you change this policy maybe students will try on they're best to get a grade B or above. Students mostly don't try hard unless they're rewarded. So next time they would want to try hard and play those activities.

On the other hand though, not every kid is good at every subject. Dear principle:

I think that changing policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average is a good idea. They will see their friends playing all these activities on their hard and best work",0
Policy1: I think we should be allowed to use our phones in lunch and free times a long as we don't use it in class. Maybe it would help us in a way cause is not fair to us that teachers do use the phone in class and we don't an that way it would be fair for both of us.,0
"They will not see the situation the way you see it. I think seeking multiple opinions will help you make a better choice rather than asking one person for advice.

It could also help you out with other situations through out life. . It can help build stronger relationships and people can trust you. It can also help you out with other situations later in life. You will have an open mind and you will know what to say when other people ask you for advice. When asking for advice, 93% of the people in America talk to more than one person. What one person has to say is different from what another person says.

People understand things differently. If they do not completely understand your situation they could say the wrong thing. When you talk to more than one person to ask for advice you start to see things differently. Sometimes people may have some of the same thoughts but not every situation has the same solution. This is why you should talk to more than one person when asking for advice, you can get other peoples opinions, the way others understand your situation, you can see situations differently. Everyone you know thinks differently. This is why you should talk to more than one person when asking for advice, you can get other peoples opinions, the way others understand your situation, you can see situations differently.

When you talk to more than one person to ask for advice you can get other peoples opinion. Some people you talk to will not understand your situation. When they say the wrong thing it could make your situation a lot worse. While others will know exactly what to say and do because they probably have been in situations like yours.

You can see other situations differently. It changes the way you think about any situation. Knowing what to do when other people ask you for advice can help you out with a lot through life. You should always have multiple people you know you can trust and you could talk with to ask for advice in any situation. Trust is very important because people can talk to you about anything and you will know how to react and what to say.

In conclusion, talking to more than one person to ask them for advice can help you make the better choice",0
"Working in groups can be helpfull if students know how to use it and take advantage of the opportunnity. It brings everyone else down.

Working alone makes students not have to worry about others not doing their part of the work.

Most students get to use different ideas when they work on groups. For example The teacher assignes a project and they have to be in groups of five and two of the students do their work and the other three don't do their work. It should be the best way to get work done and be able to help each other out. For example each student gets to be in charge of one part of the assignment so everyone contributes and work gets done faster. For example students get together to start talking about how they are going work together and start giving differents ideas on how to work better as a group

Working in a group makes students jobs less complicated and stressful by having others helping each other

Working in groups students get to help each other out. communication is key to work in groups.

Working in groups benefits one another by working faster, communicating with each other, helping each other out when someone is not understanding something and giving different ideas. Communication helps in different ways,helping someone if they don't understand something,Giving advice to another student if they feel like they are stuck or need a different opinnion or not agreeing with someone else there's always a different way to communicate that to each other. Benefits on working with a group is a better way to get work done because most students get to use different ideas,Helping each other out with different parts on projects finishing work faster,and communicating with each other is key if working in groups.

However not everyone would agree with this position, because it benefits of working alone is most students don't have to wait on others to do their work. Helping each other out is really important to the group and communication is key when students work in groups.

Communication with each student in the group is really important if students working in groups want to get work done. For example each member of the group comminicates with each other and work gets done faster. ",0
"also when we have the opportunitly to help peple,

Afther that, so many people are rude, bute we need to be humbly every time, also we can demonstrate humbly, when we go in the bus sad hi or good morning, also in the morning when we get up sad good moring to the parents, or every time sad thanks when person give you somthing, and not to be impolite.

conclucion, I belive we can demostrate respect , on my words if we need respect, first we need to respect every people, no ridicule to the another persons, we can stop the bulling to the childrens, and adults peple, also respect every singol day. So we need to be a good peron every time. With your mom, dad , brother, teacher, friends, grandmother. . with your's adults, we need to follower the rulers.

Secondly, character traits such as can be kindess chose, for exemplo my friend this morning and last nigth, they both asked can other for things and instead for of becaing a horrible person. dont forwet the rulers, be friendly, the love alweys with you. Firstly, I think the politics a good thing.

However some people feel that requiring, I belive a person can change traits, aslo has a great politic, so many people wants to be a good person, but maximun of the people are good and bad. alway we need to be nice with another persons, we need to be honest, aslo when we have a horrible friends we need to be nice with them",0
"You can ask some friends or family for some help then it can help you go the right way. Like for one person can tell you one thing and a other person can tell you something else. But you still don't know what to do. It helps more by asking more people because while you have your info they have there info as will. All really because everybody thinks different. like for example you are doing some hard work at school and you want the right answer you are not just going to ask one person you are probably going to ask more then one person. Then you will have no clue how to being aging. So you can more.  . So then you ask for more advice. And last of all ask more then one person can probably get you the right answer. Because you have gotten so much fact and options you can finish faster.

All Am saying is ask for some help and you can get the right answers and you can probably make some friends too. And maybe get mad and not finish your work. But all so all the opinion you got can help you a long way. So then you can have more knoallige about whatever you doing. Last of all it's better to ask more people because like I said you can get more knoallige on the topic and will help you one making the better choices as will. I think u should ask for more help and advice. Thats how you can get some more info. you can probably can get the answer faster by telling more then one person. So then you ask for some advice from family and friends. so you can pick the better choices.

You can get more info on the topic you are doing. you should other people for help.

you can help you pick the right choices. Then at last you all ready know what to do. Imagine you are going to buy some new shoes but you don't know if you should get them. But if you do ask a lot of people you can probably can get confused. It's all ways good to get more info on your topic because you don't ever want to do something with out any knoallige.

People can help you answer stuff faster",0
"Is working with a group is Benefits? In my opinion working with a group is better then working by yourself,becuase when we work as a group we can finish our work faster then working alone furthermore in group work you can make new friends,you can learn how to work as a team because in group work you have to make sure you are being nice to your team mates and you must listen to everyone else point of viewe in group work people you learn how to respect others.

Working with a group have more benefits then woking alone becuase if you have a big project to do and your teacher allows you to work as an group but you choose not to join any group and decide to work alone so this will be hard for you to complete the project on time and the people who join the group can easily complete the project before you because they can help each other this is the biggiest benefit of working with a group.

In group work all the members of the group have to do equal work and this way they can do their part of the project very easily and if they work alone they are not abel to work that well because they have no one else to gave them advice or any kind of help therefore group work is always benefit.

Some people might think that group work should not be allow but in my opinion group work is the best way to study becuase this way you learn about how to be nice to some one and how to be responsibel for your work becuase in team work you always have to do some part of the work which your team memebers told you to do and you all can share your thoughts about your work and can get better grade on the project Group work always gives you benefits.",0
"Students will be stressed out for being in school for to long. They won't have enough time to finish their homework and they won't have enough time to do their house work. It's enough for students for being at school for almost 8 hours. Therefor, the school board should not increase school hours each day.

In conclusion, the school board should not add one and a half hour to school each day because most students have stuffs to attend after school, students can't work for to long because they will get tired, and students need enough time to be out of school and have fun. If the school decides to add one and half hour than the students will have hard time focusing on their activities.         . They should have enough time to prepare their self's for the activity they are doing. If the school board adds more hours than it will be difficult for students to handle all the school work. There are many students who take after school clubs and activities. So the school board should not increase school hours each day.

last, the school board should not add one and a half hour to school because the students need some time to be out of school and have fun. They should go to fun places after school to get their mind of out of stressful things and have a great time with their friends. The students will feel exhausted in school and will be to tired to do school work. If they stay in school for extra hours than their brain won't be functioning that good. It's enough for students to be at school for about 8 hours but if the hours increase than the students will be extremely tired. Therefor, the school board should let students have time to go home and practice and get done whatever they need to.

Next, the school board should not add one and a half hour to school each day because students can't work for too long because they will get tired. The school board should not add one and a half hour to school each day because most students have stuffs to attend after school, students can't work for to long because they will get tired, and students need enough time to be out of school and have fun.

"in sometimes we feel like terrible but we can change that when is the right time to do it but there is where we don't want to change anything in our way and when is to like we want to do something but is very late for some of us. but I will feel like wire when I'll see a book about myself because will be all what i did before and who I'm now. for example if i did something what i keep in my mind and I try to get back the time and now is to late is something what I can't do now I will fell like I help others to don't do what is wrong and they life. He will change others life and what he is writing I will be happy with that because others guys will see what was wrong and what they have to change and they life. but the, Author Ralph Emerson wrote, my story because he though was important to to talk about other person and thing about what they do or what is going on in different's in some life and moved to others to change something but when we know any story or we red something the first thing we see on it is the what is important and what and what part describe the person in the story. for reasons like that is they like to we have author and good storys.. Some reasons I'll be happy wrote something about my self is because i will be important is some one or some one will see they self in my self and then they will be happy to see the problem in other easy way I'll do the different to other person like me.

Other reason is because I will feel like finally I share my own story with the world and they will know how hard is lived in the world, for some people and how easy is for other.

When finally about my story they will put they face up and will feel like I'm not the only person with this life someone in the world have the same life I do now and the will be different and will said yes to the life they have in the present because all of us know how hard the problem are our own life.

I agree with him because him try to proud my own story and try to be different then others he thing about my experience and try to change what i did wrong in my life. when the author will writing something he get the all information he can can fist and then stars with the the important part to proud the feeling to reading that story.

the author like to share what he know ir what he investige fir others and try to moved others to grow up when they feel like they can follow the liofe but there is where they stop to something wrong tehy are doing at the time",0
"This is one of the most enjoyable educational stuff you can do and its fun.

This is an enjoyable thing to do you have so much fun doing a project,and Helping out friends by giving them ideas for the project working as a team to make it perfect and learning. Also working as a team with you'r friends is helpful because you get to hear different parts,and it would help you learn more about the project you are doing.

Working as a team to see the different points of view of everyone is fun,and it helps for the project. This type of projects give you a lot of knowledge, and this projects give you an idea on how nature works is easy to do and is fun. Learning is boring but the science projects make learning more fun and it gives ideas for future projects. The most fun part of a project is that you get to repeat things more then once in order to get the correct results is the most fun thing during a project testing out stuff.                                                . This is an educational fun project because you get to see how the reaction of different chemicals. One educational activity I like to do is doing a science project is the most fun thing to do with your friends. Working on a project with friends is always gonna be fun specially on a science one because you have to repeat the project three times to make sure it gives the same result every time and its super educational to do.

The chemicals you use during a project could be dangers but at the same time they could be fun to use. For me this is the most fun thing to do when i have a project, and theres so many more activities but a science project is enjoyable to do and is also the most fun thing to do. If the project is about nature the things you'r gonna learn are fun and easy for example what causes wind,solar system,and how does the moon help us this projects are gonna make you learn about how earth works. Also getting help form your friends is better everyone gets to give ideas and help with the fun project. This is one of the most enjoyable educational things to do.

Doing a science project gives knowledge specially if is about nature. A science project is also fun because you get to work with chemicals and see the reaction of each chemical. This is fun because you get to help friends out, and do experiments with chemicals. Presenting the the project would make you nervous if your by your self if you did it in a group its gonna be fun and also more easy",0

Failure make me stronger and bring me success. some people are loss of enthusiasm but some people they do not by keep trying.

"Some people argue that there should be year rounds schools,where there would be a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring fall.

This is the opinion of some educators that think the students dont need a long vacations ,because they cannot retain the learned in the past year, some students think the same .The system to the long long vacation for students in high school can be a very problematic because they are start the adultlife and need time off for live.

The idea that the students's vacations need are more short is bad because the students in high school needs long period of vacation for find their firts job, some students need travel to other country for visit their family and need a long vacations; if the students not have a good long vacations they can stressed and have other nervous problems.

For this situation to improve that the vacation are very short is impossible because not all students have a same system to live and some need time to find independitzation, some enjoy with their family and other can study in their homes, in other words the students need explore the world and this only can possible when have time in vacations the rest of the year they can study.

Educators and other people that think the system of short vacations need understand that before they was a students and they also was need vacation for forget all thing and enjoy the life.

The other side for take postion in this issue is that the short bacations are goof for not forget the learned in old classes.

Some people think that the student need a long periods of vacation specifically in summer , but this is bad because the student only need study and the student cannot retain the information for long time and they need more time in the school for learn more thing and repeat the learned in past years.. Most students enjoy summer vacations,but some educators feel that the summer break is too long and the students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall",0

I think working in the supreme store can sometime give use free stuff. so i can learn how to work.

Why i want to work there is because supreme toys or hats or cups are vary valuable and by the older it gets the more is caused.

thats how Gucci started that had hard time but one day the blue up they started selling a lot of things but Gucci is very expensive. I dont know if its a good working there or if they pay good money to work there for a day or two but thats why i want to try something new some thing that i enjoy. each week they drop new supreme things like bags and cups and hats t shorts they drop new thing each Thursday and new thing they dont drop the same things because if they drop the same things each week the value of the the thing they dropped it will go down so they make share that everything the drop is new. And seeing if im a good worker and to see if the boss will let me stay there . I want it to be my first job. But if i like it and the boss tells me to stay i will stay and maybe move to

Generic_City of & Generic_Citynbsp; but i want to go there for a summer so work docent distraked me from school. but new thing or valuable to if the people like it and if it sells out . My brother and i are trying to start a big supreme culashoin.

Its to get experiences i want to help him with his work and i want to feel all the presser he gets so one day i try to start something ill have the experiences. After doing all of that i want to start my own organization so i can start something like that thats why i want to work there because i can learn about the how he started supreme and what he did to make supreme famous. people make a living out of it because some thing cause millions of dollars working there can get me thing that are vary expensive for free of half the price. So i want to show the boss that im a good worker but i want to see if that job is for me because if i go and work there for a day and the boss likes me and tells me to stay and i dont want to stay working there because the job is no for me im going to regret it. to work there for a while. so i think they should let me stay.              . I want to work there because i cant get things faster and i can see what there going to drop every Thursday. but Generic_City is the original place where it was first created.

I feel like ill be caorthuble working there because thats the thing i like doing and thats the type of stuff ill like to sell and I will like working there because my brother likes supreme and i like it to",0
"If we put limited using to much techonology we cannt effect our life and we can see that we can survive with that. Has the limitation of human contact due to the use of techology had positive or negative effects on people's lives.

(

middle)

Because people sometime left the important stuff for be on their phone and that can distract to be preparate for any other things. but for person's who has business is more easier by using techonology. And students who need to make some homework or look for somenthing is a good choose.

Thousand of people's can a bad decition on using the techonology, because they never put a limited choosing not good decition but other's people used very well and understand that we have real life and we need to preparate for make a very well deciton, techonology had positive and negative effects.. Also people's due bad things like don't put attention on class or don't look their childs .However people's like to much techonology that they do all with that, we sometime are not responsible that we fight we others person's just for we cool or for be increduble",0
"In fact,all in the world has advantages and disadvantages as I mentioned.

One of the advantages that I can see is that teenagers are going to be more hours doing good things being in the school,and not waisting their time doing things that are disturbing for them. We are teens,we just want to have a good adolescense. We can start doing little things like turning off the lights of our house when we do not stay there,or when we do not use them. One example can be when people who need a babysitter to take care of their children,we know that person also have a family or have things to do after job and if her job take more time that she usually do is going to affect her. Conserve and earn energy is a big challenge for all,we thought that little things like leave the lights turn on for along time and do not use them is a loose of energy and money,those little things affect us believe it or not and of course affects our aconomy. We can provide huge things to our country and the world if we want.. An example of sunlight energy can be the calculators that need to be charged with light,so they do not need batteries which is a good one.

The government and obviously every single person need take care of this amazing resource to conserve it for a long time. I thing that can help us to reduce the lost of energy,but at the end we make the change. The period of time that we used to have to finish the unity for each class sometimes does not adjust and we get busy,imagine if we just have four days of school plus the teens that like to be absent. Those are my thoughts,so we can help our world being more educated with our enviroment and the resources that they provide for us. The good thing is that we are going to have one more day off out of school. Not all of the people are able or agree to work till late,and if they accept they want to be paid more.

Having a long days of school,I mean more hours that we used to do can be stressful for students that are very mischievous or rude,they just want to go home early as they can and if the school add more hours they are going to be more rude than they are. Energy is something indispensable in our life,so if we do not take care of that resource we are going to have a lot of problems in the future,as energy become more expensive or something like that. We used to have two days out of school,but now we are going to have three,so if we add the days like early dismissal,vacations,or because of the weather those are going to be lost days,in fact we are going to lost more days,so I think that is going to affect our academic life. I believe the change is going to be stressful for many parents who both of them need to work. Energy is one of the most expensive resources,we pay for electricity,because to reproduce energy it goes through an expensive process.

The prompt says that adopt a four days of work with each day consisting of ten hours it is going to conserve more energy. All of those resources complement each other to do their functions for example: without water we would not have energy,water helps to make energy when it is coming down like a waterfall,so there is when water produce energy. I think ten hours of school is not going to make a big difference,first of all that change will create many conflicts with students who practice a sport,have things to do after school,or need to work after school the time is not going to adjust.

Parents will get in troubles to pick their children or to leave them in an extracurricular activities,even if the school adopt that proposal that does not mean that all of the jobs and schools are also going to adopt it,so that is going to affect families who have children in that school. We also know the sun is an energy reproducer and we can get a natural energy,the type of machine that is used for that kind of energy is a little expensive,but is better than a normal energy that we use every single day, it is less dangerous for our enviroment. We usually go to school an average of seven hours,if the businessses want to add two or three more hours to be in total ten hours taking out one day,and becoming just four days of school each day ten hours of work,In my opinion is going to be the same,because the two or three extra hours that they would add is the same that one more day of school;however,what is going to happen with the students that are in sports,have other activities or students that are in clubs,they will going home till night,I believe that is not good for anybody,they are not going to have time to do their homework for the next day,or an extra activity if they want during the rest of the day.

In conclusion let the things stay same till this day,we can conserve energy doing other type of proposal that not affect too much the people and their activities. Energy and many different resources are a big patrimony that nature gave us,every single person need to take care of every single resource that we have like energy,water,etc",0
"Technology had positives effects in people lives, it helps them in many ways like emergency, transport, and security.

Technology helps people in case of emergency, it helps them to comunicate with emergencies. It helps keep people alive in the way to the hospital. . After school students can do their homework instead going to other places like in the pass.

Technology helps people with security, people use cameras to keep secure places. It helps doctors when they make an peration.

Technology helps people with transportation, people can travel around the country from place to place. Also technology can help doctors, to determinate what is wrong with the patient. In schools they use technology to teach student how our first genaration was, how they dress and how hard was to live in the time. People use transportation when they have to work. People will have more avanced technology in the future. if someone wants to travel to others country, they can take a airplane or a helicopter.

Technology helps people in education, teachers use technology to teach. Technology also helps with the traffic security, like lights in the road to see where are you going, see if the car infront of you stops, and cars have cameras to see when you are going back.

In conclusion technology had a great impact on peoples lieves, because it helps alot with transport, emergency, education and other. Also helps people in case of emergency, by taking them to the hospital. They use cameras in places like shopping store, food markets, restaurants and other places. Student can find any information about projects in the internet",0
"In my opinion I think that the classes online or the video conferencing can a lot of students, if they are busy or if they are interented in this classes they can take it too.. Also, if they are in a normal school and they want to keep learning by the summer they easily can take the classes online or the video conferencing. Also, if you need to go to work, you can go to work and in your free time take the classes online. Take classes online is a good opcion for busy people because some times they do not have enough time to make food, do the homework and go to school, sometimes they need money so they need to work, and they look at this like an obstacle that keep them away from school. Take classes Online can help busy students, but is you are interested in take this classes can help you too. By taken classes online they can make a better sketch, eat at home, do the homework, have more time to do the things that they need to do at home. Another reason is that some students live far away from the school, and they do not have a car or transportation, is more easy for them to take the classes online in the comfort of their home. For example if you have a baby, you can take care of you baby, and they the classes olnine at home",0
"you should try to encourge to them, say you are good, if student have some fault really, Don't say no ,should say:I think you can do it better.

It improtant to make progress when they are growing up. the great education is nurtured little by little early. I think seif-esteem come from praise, in my opinion, praising is good for student to built self-esteem by theirself.

expecially the praise come from their teacher, you know everyone like that other guys to praise him/her, i dont want to my parents criticize to me. I trust you can do it or blame them simply ,Let me compare and think about it. actually right or wrong is not improtant. they are fragile, because they have different thought, more blame to others, more counter to you. even though common people, I care people's talk, Dosen't everybody care?

as a student, I understand that means in my mind, if I make some mistake, I know this is my fault early, when teacher criticize to me ,I will so sad, It isn't has a strong mind in everyone's heart, we are human not god, so don't bring blow to kid when he/ she get trouble. but this is serious that you want to probe the problem of the learn is necessary, we can't blow them.

In a words, even thouht always miss''right anwer'', try to praise me and friends, you are good,and you can do better, I am also proud of myself, self-confident make me too strong, whatever they say anything, adjust mind by myself, that is prefect enough !. It's not in the same way.

You are distinctive! I really think that is truth. i admit you are right so long as you can say you understand by use your way",0
"Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. Technology can take over someones life they can be hooked to it. That will increase oversize teens and adults in America. People can check out books,shop,and play games without speaking to another persons .Has the limitation of human contact due to the technology has positive or negative effects on people's lives? I think this is negative, because the rate of oversize people will grow. That can cause to death and in that way we would have a lot of deaths. Not away in our houses getting what u want from online and letting people you haven't meet and hadn't meet you determine who or what u are let your friends say what they thing and u tell yourself who and what you are.. That its self harms the brain all types of ways.

Although, people are getting there things done without having to go and talk to other people. They also meet people online and let what the people online think of them. They should go out in the real world and see how things are. They can lose a lot of vitamin D. we as people should stand up for each other. and our population will decrease because of technology.

In Conclusion, what the people are doing isn't right technology shouldn't keep us away from each other. People shouldn't spend most of there time on devices or inside. we should get out more and have a community picnic and be with each other. that effects a lot of peoples lives.

Then, teens would be on video games all day rather than go out and do something active. How nice people are to them .

First, Being stuck in the house isnt fun because you won't meet new people or reconnect with people from your old school or meet the love of your life .Things like this is what makes people kill their self because they dont have fun",0
"No i think students should not have any cell phones at school at all because there could a lot of noises , and maybe it could be distracting to other students . So that's distracting and a waist of time isn't it. That's why i think students should not have cell phones during the school time .

To begin with student should not have cell phones during the school time because it could make a lot of noises . so if you have a cell phone right and your in class and its in high volume and you receive a call or a text message that's not right because teachers are trying to teach you and all your doing is making noise . That's why i think they should not have cell phones during school hours because its distracting .

Those are the reasons why they should not allow cell phones during the school hours because is distracting and it makes to many noises .. That's why i think we should not have cell phones during the school time .

In addition i think we should not have cell phones in school hours because it could be distracting to the students or even the teachers , because last week there was a girl texting during class and the teacher saw her so he had to stop his lesson and take her phone away and rite her a referral ",0
"For example,My uncle when my came to united States he always do somethings with his hand such as construction and fix people car my uncle always doing somethings new if thous wasn't good them but tried able to accomplish them as such files tax for people he was able accomplish them.

My uncle now files tax people get pay a lots;

when people do not know how files tax they came to him files for them by that he was successful because he accomplish more if always doing somethings now he has own company where people work for him. The first my brother do his internship how to construction wasn't good at all but he was also keep doing it instill he was able accomplish it now he know to how to fix roof and many more things he is expert construction build. She always practical how to read in English and write English. Another example, it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing lead successful for example,Bill Gate who always doing somethings he was the first person to create Microsoft.

Bill Gate like always like do somethings with computer. Thomas Jefferson say it is always good do something. This show that it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something. This that It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you gain experience. He was successful because he always like to do somethings

Bill Gate was rich man on the whole world today because he always do somethings build computer. Although some might argue that, it is better to does inactivity also serve a purpose, actually it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something because can lead successful and you gain experience.

It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something can lead to successful. for example, my brother who was doing somethings he able to accomplish more things. This show that

It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you gain experience.

The other side claim that it is better to does inactivity also serve a purpose, because you can be more wise about around you however it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned for example, when my mom came to American she did not know how to speak English. Having you wonder why people able to accomplish so much just in few days? Today society people always works so much they miss out their opportunity in life. This show that it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something because can lead successful

It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you gain experience. She was able to accomplish that because she always somethings with English leaned how speak English. I use thought that wasn't at my math class but always do somethings in my class able to gain experience in class. Another example I wasn't good at Algebra at all I was fail the class also Got F on classwork and test to

I decide to stay after with teacher start practical math question I understand little by little but the first take my math test able pass test got B on the test my first every to got B on math. Never stop trying something new in life it will turn out be more successful then you never to be expected. Although some might argue that, it is better to does inactivity also serve a purpose they are wrongs. He always advisory worker in order for you to successful always do somethings new. This show that is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned.

Another example It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned . Always doing something you can learned from it for example I did not know how to cook anythings any time put dish on fire never come out good but when always keep cook it start to turnout good I was able accomplish always something new with my dish.

Finally it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something because can lead successful and you gain experience.  ",0
"Because the majority of people impression can chang etheir over time or by the area sourounding them, and figer out how make time to understand how it goes and how people thier features from influence by the socity around us and how I said can give the impress with your senserity follow people's impressions, and literally the word impression is the sence of feeling in how someones feeling from sirten situation.

Seeing the reality, Most humans have their way of reactions to react to every thing they can show or chang by somehow in their life, In this period of time no one like to listen to someone's story, Real people who shows their impressions by the area sourounding them it effects us as who we are and the time that we are in, So the place that we are often been can effect our impressions, The place that we been raised in can impact on our impression. Places and moumints can be on of the reasons why people impressions are mostly can change by this way, This kind of things might be wired to be impossible. So to see people impression we have to see thier past and what they been throw, Many of them change there mood, and some might change after a prolem has been solved.. People's reactions might chang after an accident happen to some one's in the past It can be a very big and huge chang for some one's reactions if we see them the next time or day. Because when I was yonger from now my dad allways use too tell me

""too mach agreement kills a chat"". Emotions and there behavioral changes in some bodeis deppend on how they think by a word or emotinal apperance can be changed with their behavioras, and some might be in need so bad for somthing and that can also shows their impressions behavioral chang.

When I was in my country many people came to the area where we live there was so many that your mind can't relate to what we see and we all were very nice to them and we gave them many of the things that we have and as much we can, There was so many kids from them I use to be realy sad when I see them like that I refused to give every thing I can to them but some of them was vrery hungry and some are mean but I said to my self in my mind that their impreesion won't be like that if they weren't in need like that. Because the majority of people might be mad when from somthing when we see them from the first time, I disagree with this statement because most people chang there impressions when they're in a spicific mood, Some might change after a proplem has been solved. To see someone impression, that might be possible to chang. Many peple chang thier imperssions after the first time we see them.

So I have a frined who allways chang her mood by any time, some times she would come to my house and knock on the door even if we were just argued about something, but when I saw her the first time when we met she was very nice and my parent invited her to my house and her first time her impression was very happy and intersted to see us and learen about our culture, so when I saw her the next day we were so happy that we met. To see people's impression, I have to look at them when they are in thier good time that will chang the ideas. and I told her my trip how we came to the US, she was so impress to know more about us, But some time she woluld change becaus of her parents and when she's sad she comes to my house and tell me how she has been and how her family is with her, and I was listen to her as she tells me every thing, But when some one come to our house and see's her like that they say that she's wired from how she acts, but her first imression was't like that, she changes with what impact throw her life, and we're a teens also, Every day my parents sees her they say that she's very talented because she has a very good voice and I use to be so happy to see her singing because she had a good voice, but her impreesion changed after I saw her how she reacts with others, and I use to get surprised of how she's diffeent with methen others, but now I found that people are like a door each person need a spacial key to open them and understand how they feel and think. and to affect especially forcibly or deeply to some one's mind when they see some one impressions for the first time.

I encorage everyone to change thier opinion about the first impression are almost impossible to change",0
"When you imaging something, your brain brings back the data from your past and puts it in your imagination. Also, In that way your brain are becoming more conscious by your little thinking process and it's making your brain stronger everyday.

Imaginary can make you an open minded person. How would you feel when you see your robot went viral in the world and people liking it? Your robot machine went from an a imaging thing to a big successful robot machine.

Also It helps your mind get stronger. From your idea, you made the robot and It worked just the you wanted it to work. You are learning something new everyday, your brain collecting data based what you do in a everyday life basis. In that way,you know what you should in your imaginary work. More than 100 years ago, people used their mind to build machines, planes, rockets, television , bridges, etc. Next, you will give them some helpful advises that will make them better. Sometimes when you imagine something that you know you will do it no matter who stops you, It may come to real life and change the whole world. For example: think that you designed a machine from your imagination about a robot maid who can help you to clean your house , do your laundry, make you dinner, washing the dishes, etc. If you are good at imaging, when you are gonna talk to other people and they tries to explain you their situation, First, you will imagine yourself into that situation. Second, you will understand what they have been went through. Our world's one of the brilliant scientist of all time Albert Einstein said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" I think that imagination is more important than knowledge in a lot of ways.

""Imagination""

is the power of mind to make something creative. Most of the things were build my their own imagination. When you thinking about anything, your brain is running from one place to another place to get the next task. And then your robot went to the market and the people brought it and loved the machine. Then you will think what should I do to make that person feel better. On a human, the brain is the strongest part of their body. It control your body. It can change a lot of thing in the world that you didn't thought of. It makes you a good person, It makes you open minded, It helps your brain to get stronger. In a human brain, we do 5% conscious and 95% unconscious things everyday. If they feel safe around you, they will be more comfortable to tell more about them in future.

In conclusion, I think imagination is better than knowledge. And that way you will be able to help others'    . Also, world's one of the biggest thing from a human brain is imagination",0
"I don't like to many works to be doing at the same time, so I try to finish one per day so later on I wont have to come and start to do the same work I was supposed to finish the day before. That's what I'm trying to change in this job. So if you need that type of employee I think I'm the right person, because I will work very hard to finish the job by one day. I like to make other people work hard to, not just me, because if we all work hard we are all going to be successful in this job, I'm not trying to be successful by myself, I like to see more people success in life.               . I think this are good reasons why I would be a good candidate to be hire for this job, I'm here trying to get this job, so I can help the others to be good workers and help the company look better, because we will work hard and be responsible to make the best out of the best.

Sinceraly.

Generic_Name. I'm a responsible guy, who likes to be able to help the others if they need help in anything. I'm always on time. Like I said I like to work hard, to finish everything by the same day. If I want to go out and be with friends, the first thing that I tell them is that I have to finish my work if I have time to go out after work then I will be able to go with them, but if Im not done then I cant go, because the job is the first thing that we all should have in mind, then the second thing are friends, free time, all that kind of stuffs.

Second, I'm a hard worker in any job, because I like to demonstrate that I can do the best and any job at anytime. A lot of people tells me that I should get this kind of job, because I dont like when people are irresponsible and since I'm a responsible worker the rest of employers will like how I work, then they will start to their work just like I'm doing mine. Hey dear employees.

I'm writing this letter to tell you about some of my characteristics that are needed for this kind of job. Also I'm a hard worker because I'm constantly doing work, never stopping to do anything else if I'm not do with my work.

I'm always trying to able to do all the work and to help the others if they don't know how to do it. A lot of employees dont work hard for the job that they have, if they dont work hard, that makes the company or the rest of workers look bad because he doesn't want to do anything. I'm trying to get this job because I know that I can help other people succeed, I can make this work by helping others and by working hard every day.

"So you can understand why problems are not bad as you think of. Almost everyone in the world had a big problem in their life. So, I created a goal that I want to see my brother again,and it did happen. My reasons are that problem make us work/push harder, it creates/set our goals, and importantly it make you learn from your mistakes.

Problems make us work/push harder. However, if you think of it problems is not that bad as you think. Problems are the reasons why the world is still together and not fighting. Problems make us push harder, create goals, and the most important part it make us learn from our mistakes. Then, when I know what's the reason I just dont do it again so no problems will be created. Problem is not rare this days. Problems are pushing to set a goal that we will create the opposite of problems. But they work hard and hard because problems make us work harder. Many buisnessman have many problems. Humans are created to enjoy life and learn from problems to problems.. I have several reasons why I agree on Duke's statement. Brain and feelings are created so we can't make the same mistakes as before. When I got a problem I always ask my self ""What did I do wrong?"". Problems make us go together and help each other. Problems make us create goal to achieve. I compare it like that because the bunny/fox is like the problem we want to face it and end it.

My other reason is that problems create/set our goals. Like what happened to me when I was a kid. Because before problems mistakes comes first. Problems set as goals that we would not do the same mistakes again.

Last but not the least, problems make us learn from our mistakes. When you learned your mistakes and don't create another problem their where it proves that ""Problems make us learn from our mistakes"". My brother and me are a great example of that. I never seen my brother since I was 3 years old. Problems make us to push harder. When a person have a problem of course their going to create/set a goal to complete. All of these reasons are very important to know. Its like we are the turtle in the race where the turtle and bunny/fox race. Like what Duke Ellington said "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best"", and I agree on what he said. So we can prevent many similar problems in our life.

My reasons why I agree are that problem make us work/push harder, it creates/set our goals, and importantly it make you learn from your mistakes. Like what the movie(Your My Boss) said ""A Good Buisness-man Need Problems To Do Better""",0
"my central idea is supported with introduction specific imformation to the other people that we can check other books the conclusion is bring good idea with the other contact and use the technology we need bring good idea together for more imformation and take good reasons the people need to have something for pay games without speaking with other people and they need stay together for to do that.

The people need the contact for comunication with the other human for to do more technology and for that can to do more games the people need to do more imformation for to do more something for comunication with the other human for pay the games without speaking with other person my idea is that they have more contact with the other companies for have good idea and together going to have good imformation and they need take good idea.

The person need to have good activite when to do the games and the people they need to have money for to do the games because the boss need pay to the employee and the employee need to think more better for to do good games, but they need to use more technology the people need use the comunication and the technology for pay their games and my other idea is that they need to have more technology for to do how a large screen for show the games to the anoher companies or to the other person who want buy the games and they can pay the game use the technology.

The other companies can check the books and the games in the large screen because they builded the large screen with their technology and they can speaking with other person and it's important to help to the person with their comunication because we need to learning about to the new tehnology that they builded and the employee need to brings good ideas for the boss for to do the games more better with the new technology.

with the other technology new they can show the books in the other companies and they need to do activite with the other employee then the need to have good life and they need to do vacation for relax for that have good ideas the employee to have access for get more better the games because they want to build good games for the persons the employee need get something that can they to do idea they can work with the other person that they can to do good work.",0

First some people are in someone problems like a Job maybe need once step to better position or salary. For example, is hard to complete the academic studious and dont loss of enthusiasm is the key for they are success.

There last one reasons, is pursuit of success is important in the life for each people for better future. The second reasons is for the young people in the (school or college) is very difficult to do study, work, etc. There last one reasons is pursuit of success is important in the life for each people for better future.

First some people are in someone problems like a job maybe need one step to better (position or salary), example somebody have a Job and once

Office but they need more experience, and more ideas for increase the production and the best thing to do would be is to trust in self.

The second reasons is for the young people in the (school or college) is very difficult to do study, work,etc.  . Because some people have many projects from school, Offices, Jobs, and Family need to make sure that from many ideas and to put the best ideas, and dont loss the enthusiasm. In this reasons from Churchill's statement",0
"My thoughts on what author Ralph Waldo had wrote, is something I can agree with. If he wanted to be a manager and own his own company, he would have to be the hardest worker there and show that he can handle and work and follow all the rules. If you believe you can do anything then you are growing and realizing that all you need to do is to be fearless and take risks. I was pretty proud of myself and gave me courage.

Once you've done something in your life that was huge and still did the same thing over and over what would you grow from it. If someone was to started off as a employee at McDonald and was thinking of being a manager somewhere and have his own company how could he do that if he's just a worker at McDonald. He told me that if don't take the wheels off, how will I grow and take risks in life when im older and have big things that i'd have to develop and learn what I made a mistake on not doing and learn from my mistake. I was to afraid and nervous that I wouldnt be able to ride the bike with training wheels so I didn't let him take them off. My parent had saw that I have gotten the hang of it and told me that I should try and do it with out the training wheels. That's the point of growing. the manger realizes that he's got a big future ahead of him. I have learned so much and ready to learn more and to become successful in my life. Ralph Waldo has gave people the courage and make them think that they can do anything to become someone you'd never thought you could be. The things i have experience and has made me the person I'am today, has taught me that doing the same things will not help me learn and grow. You are in this world to learn and grow. So i started to think to myself, ""If i didn't take them off how will I know that im good or horrible"". Being fearless and taking a risk on something, will change me and anyone else to a more powerful and successful person.

When I was young, my parents had gotten me a bike with training wheels, I had started to ride it and it was pretty difficult to ride. Every day when I came home from school, I would go outside and ride my bike. I told my dad to take them off, once he took them off i was pretty scared but then i started to get better and better that i wasn't afraid. The statement Ralph Waldo had wrote is something i agree with and will grow to be successful.. Year's later, he's a manager at his own company and is being successful in life he's learned that not giving up and risking things to become what he is now is incredible.

Last but not least, if someone is not challenging them self, how would they know that they are good at it and could be able to do so much. I started to get better and better, I was'nt struggling anymore. To become a stronger, and successful person to accomplish something big and grow from where they have started. He ends up getting a raise and is the employee of the month for showing that he's a hard worker",0
"We can show a lot characters in our work such as: be respecfull, be on time, and the most important things is love our jobs.. He was doing well his job in New York, but he needed moved. Working hard is the best way to demonstrate you can work in any place and loves your job.

The second reason is when you are working is important to leave an excellent record, because it help to develop a good characteristics and experience. Every labor is admirable, and we can care our jobs because it depends we can accomplish any goal we has in our life. Some people do not like to follow the rules when they are in their jobs.

In conclusion, we can not change the entire world, but start been responsible and working hard in our jobs is beneficial, because it is the place where we can inspire others to do their jobs well and any company will hire us for been excellent workers. Furthermore, my uncle Generic_Name, he just moved from New York to California, and he was looking for a new job. ""Most employers are looking for specific characteristics in a potential employee. Some people may argue that be a responsible and hard-working is not necessary in a job. Can you imagine a world where every person is optimistic and responsible in their job. For example, they look for someone who is responsible and hard-working, and often they look for a person who has experience."" In some countries, start working at age of 15 years old is mandatory, because it helps to young people to obtain new views about different kind of jobs. However, be responsible is so important, because people are getting more experience and more capacity to do their labor. Generic_Name over time get a lot of experience and she inspired others people to do better their jobs. For example, my friend Generic_Name, she started worked when she was 16 years old, she studied and worked at the same time. Everyone has the capacity to be a responsible in their labor, but some people are hard-working because they want to accomplish their goals, and have an excellent record and experience from the last job is so important.

The first reason why is so important to be a hard-working is because you can accomplish your goals. He went to apply in this new place, and the employers called to Village's Company asking for details about how he was doing his job when he was working for them, and then Village's Company says ""Generic_Name was one our best worker we had, he was responsible and he have the knowledge about his job."" The new company hired my uncle because he leave an excellent record. Hiring a person who has experience is important, because it help to develop better a job. According to ""

The Washington Post,

"" 65% of the workers are hard-working and loves their job. Generic_Name's goals was: be a teacher, buy a house, a car and save money for the College. She won a prize for been doing well her job and supported others to inspire to do an extraordinary job. In some jobs, they call to ask for details about if the person have an excellent record and experience. Generic_Name worked very hard to accomplished her goals. Generic_Name worked as an engineer in

Village's Company

. It was not easy for her, but she was optimistic. She wake up every morning at 6:00 o'clock to go school, and she always fought for have a better future and accomplished her goals",0
"Principal

This is my opinion of your future change in the school activities. I have to tell that the idea of tell us about this cange and for give us the opportunity to let us tell you, our opinion is good.. Maybe the students are better in their activity because sometimes we have more fun, and because we like to be in more movement. I'm not in favor in this change, if the students are good players, the principal have to let they play at least they have a grade C average, but if the students don't have a good grade, like F or D, the principal have to tell they that they can't play anymore, till they make a good grade.

This change can do a good change because the students that play a sport or if they are in the band, and if they care more in the activity that they play, maybe that can be distorting the student, that can be the reason of why they don't have good grades, so the students what the students have to study at the same with their sport or other activity, and be good with both",0
"For instance, snow storms, or floods but working at home doesnt cause you to miss out on school. Instead they'll have all the time they need. Weather can also cause school to cancel. We don't need to do fire drills or lock down drills in our homes because we know our homes are secure. Online school is for every student. It causes lots of students stress and sometimes failure. Next thing you know the bell rings and the students havent finished the assignment yet. Unlike a classroom filled with students, your home is peaceful with no distractions.

To conclude, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Many students miss a huge amount of school days because of personal reasons, health, or sports. Students can never be absent in online school because everything is on a laptop. Our own homes make us feel relaxed and clam so therefore, its a safe environment to work in. On the other hand, some students think online school isnt for visual learners but online class has many ways to educate visual learners.

Online class has video conferencing to help better understand. Students don't have to worry about being late to class anymore either. However, taking a online class would resolve those issues. They then have to do extra work to get all caught up.                         . Students would benefit from online education because there's no reason to miss school and to work in a better environment

Whenever a student misses a day or days of school they fall behind. Instead, students will be stress free sitting on there bed learning.

Every student would rather be at home working then to be working in a classroom. They will always be up to date with there assignments or exams. Being able to attend classes online is a dream come true. Adding on to classes going by to quick, classrooms can get very loud. Also, when students are focus and working on assignments, the time goes by to quick. Working at home won't make students feel rushed at all",0
"this is our time this is our big break. students wait for this time of the year to do their vacations. . This hot temperature will make students swearing a lot and have very hard head hurt during class time level of streets will increase make students get bad grades or be angry all this time. Summer is a season with very hot weather schools take this whole season to give students a big break summer is almost 2 months of break .Although some educators feel that the summer break is too long and schools should be year round schools. our big break. Which mean schools have one month of summer and a longer winter break. Some day the temperature goes to 96c or more this is to hot for students. Hot areas make you not focus in your work.

In summer students have 2 months to enjoy make some family trip or things like that .Some students and families take this time to make some big family vacation plan. this when students can relax for a very long period without any preoccupation about schools work summer just happen one time each year students have to enjoy students deserve it for all hard work than students did in the whole school year. trip can take so much time and students think summer is a perfect time to do. In summer students have enough time do anything students want some students use this time to find a job during summer as students do not have school they are more focus making money,so summer is very important to us to have some time with our family or make money.

In conclusion summer is a hard time to go to school but a good time to make some trip or money so the government should not cut off our summer. Students who work in hot areas will feel more difficult to do a simple thing than students who work in a warm area . Because summer is a perfect time to go to the beach with family and friends or go outside the country to visit other country as we do not have school in summer we do not miss any day of school . Nevertheless I think schools should not be year round schools because summer have a very hard weather also students use this time to plan some trip with family and friends.

Summer has a very hard weather to even think go to schools",0
"Some will disagree with Ralph Waldo Emerson statement, because doing something beyond that already master will never stop you from doing it. When I was 7th grade I sign up for the girl soccer team for the school. I practice every days to get better and to try my best. When I got to 8th grade I wanted to sign up again because some of my friend was joining, then when I made in the team next then I know they voted for me to become captain for the girl soccer team. Until the moment in my life I knew that I had master my goal.

I'm 16 year old about to turn seventeen in July I have reach so many goals in my life and then it when beyond. When I was little I wanted to play soccer but I didn't started learning until I was 10 years old. I grew up become better the thing I love the most and did it because I had sibling following my foot step since I was the oldest in my family.. At the end of day I had teacher and friends that help me all my school year. In the pass year I played a Villain before I reach goal becoming beyond with a instrument that I didn't know how to play, I master how to soccer for the first when I was little, and at the end of the day your going to be beyond great when you don't give up.

When I was 6th grade in middle school I never though I was going to learn how to play instrument for the first time in my life. When I made the team I was exacted because I never though I going play for school soccer team and it was the first to play. So all this year I learn how to play a instrument that was a villain and playing a sport that love I become beyond great and master to become better. I learn so many thing on my own because my parent didn't know English. When I got to middle I learned how to play a interment for the for time in my life become beyond. The couch liked how I played but my friend though I was beyond great but I didn't believe them. My goal was to learn how to play soccer, until one day I was at the park with my family and friend I learn how to play soccer. I didn't stop growing I kept growing to become better to play.

Why won't we reach our goal then become beyond because doing something beyond your reaching a goal to finish. My uncle told me that I was fast learner that I kicked correctly with forced. The coach was beyond how I played for the game I made 8 goal in the season but I never stopped playing soccer. A Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered,you will never grow. My uncle tough me how to played soccer for the first time.

He showed me how to kick the inside and outside of my feet. This was a time where I want to learn how to play a sport. The teacher once said if stop playing then your going to forget the string note and how to used correctly. So we played soccer just kicking back and forth until knew how to kick. Some will said you'll grow but won't reach their beyond what they mastered. The one key that my parent tough me was never give up on yourself, if you don't understand the problem then go to the next problem then come back to finish the rest. The instrument that I'm now play is Villain my brother though I wasn't good enough to play a instrument. I played three year in middle school I was getting good and then I love how sound made with bows and string",0
"For some people when they try new things the only get it once without any mistakes. And when you try new thing and you fail and you give up strait away you, are not being successful, you are just ruining your life an becoming a failure because you gave up strait away. When we fail we learn from our mistakes and try again and be successful because failure is actually helping you in the pursuit of success.

On the pursuit of success we will have some hard times ahead of us, and does hard time are the mistakes we will end up making and form does mistakes comes success. Giving up ruins your life.

In life there will be challenges coming your way and you should take those challenges head on and if you fail try again and be successful, because out of those challenges comes a great price that takes you to the next level. I agree with what Winston Churchill said because it is true. Failure helps thousands of people become successful in life.

When you are trying something new, you have to happy about it, and when you fail doing that new thing you should still be happy because it is your first time doing it, and when you fail you always get a second chance to do it again, and when you fail the second time you get another chance, it will keep going until you get it at the end and giving up is not an option. Going form failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm can help be successful in the end because you tried and tried again and it gave you more confidence to go on and try things you haven't done before. You should always be happy about trying new things. Going to the next level is a big thing in life good things start coming your way and more people start to like you because of the challenges you went through and failing helped you become successful at the end of those challenges.

I agree with what Winston Churchill said because it can help us in life and in the future.. Once again giving up is not an option in the book of life. But for other people it takes the a few times before they can get it, that is going from failure to failure",0
"other student have their young ones at home while he or she want to listen to the teaching their young ones will be make noise so they can't get what the video is teaching about and that will make them not to understand the teaching.

I am not in favor of the idea of student taking online classes because they will find it very boring which they can't focus on the teaching and it will very hard for them to understand the teaching of the video.

for this way I find it very difficult for student to gained any learning from taking the online or the video conferencing class. but that does not mean student should take online classes or watch video conferencing , It not a good idea for student to be take online classes and I am not in favor of the idea for student to take online or watch video conferencing because they can find the online teaching to be boring and it will be very hard for student to understand the teaching of the video.

Although some people might think that taking online or video conferencing class can be helpful because student can get a lot of sleep before starting the class and the student will be the one to choose the time he or she wish to take the class or watch the video conferencing.

firstly why I don't agree with the idea of taking home school or watch video conferencing is because student find home school to be boring and they can't focus in the teaching of the video conferencing. like for example if the person who is teaching in the video speaks softly it will make that student feel sleeping and by the time he or she get up the video might be finish at the end of the day the student don't gained anything from the online teaching, and other student will turn on the video and still be charting with their friends on the phone while the video is playing, he or she will not focus on the video that is teaching.

secondly why I said home schooling or video conferencing can't be beneficial for student is because student will find it very hard to understand the teaching of the video conferencing or the home schooling. I know taking online or watching video conferencing class can be relaxing sometime, and sometimes student even pray for school to be close.       . like if the video is playing but the student don't understand the teaching of the video he or she can't get the chance to ask question about what they don't understand .And some of this video teaching sometime is really confusing the student that why other student prefer to set in class while teaching so that if he or she don't understand they can ask question about the topic",0
"Also, we can call to report someone or something that will harm us and others. This why technology has a positive effect on our lives. Not only we can call for emergency we can also call people we care about that we cant reach.

Final reason, We are able to talk to people we care about and love that we can't reach. Not only that it saves us time it also saves lives.

Another reason, it helps us and others on emergency situations. They say it makes people feel lazy and depend on it so much and without they feel like they can't get nothing done. We can complete many tasks without having contact with others. Although, technology has a negative effects on people lives, I believe that its positive effects is greater for few reasons.

First reason, it allows people to do much more in less time. But at the end of the day it all depends on you and how you want to use it you can make it positive or negative to your life. For example, we are able to make emergency calls at any given time for help without having to go no where. This what makes technology a positive effect on our lives because it makes everything easy.

In conclusion, technology has a positive effect on people lives because we can save time, save lives, and contact people we care about. Does technology have a negative effect on people lives? People believe that technology these days is a big part of society and that its effecting people lives in a negative way. For example, If your parents or someone you care about are in a different state or country, and you want to check in on them you can just call them without having to go or travel to them.       . For example, people can check out books, shop, and learn without having to go no where or speaking to another person",0
"Also, what a lot of people don't understand is that everyone have problems and they don't know what other people are passing through.

Sometimes you have a bad impression of someone because of what other people say and the opinion you have on them do not change until you start talking to that person, I think that this an error that a lot of us make, we judge a person without knowing how they actually are. I think everyone should first try to get along with someone and then, they can judge. I think that how a person dresses doesn't determine the type of person someone is, but if you let someone to express their feelings your opinion on them will completely change.

In addition, when you become friends with someone and you talk with them, sometimes they tell you that when you met them, they weren't having a good day. This statement is false because you can't judge a person based on their appearance because sometimes people are just having a bad day and when you become friends with them you find out how that person actually is.

For example, you meet a person that has a lot of tattoos and you have a bad impression of them, but then, you interact with that person and you find out that he/she is not what you thought; therefore you can't judge a person based on their appearance. It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. For example, once I had a friend that talked really bad about a girl and I believed everything he said, but when I started talking to her, she was completely different from what this one friend had told me about her.

In conclusion, people are not always what they seem to be and you can't judge them on how they look. That's why I think that you can change first impressions.",0
"For example, In history there are students that don't understand they would just sit in their seats and not ask for help. Its best for students to be in school rather than be home school.. When we got our projects back we got an A and the student got a B. I am writing about should students work in schools or their homes. Those were the things we both like too he was my first friend in that school. This shows that in schools we should be with other students to bring in ideas, ways that others can't see.

In school you can be well taught and understand better when people like teachers, or other students help them. In my class students can be helped by fellow classmate or the teacher.

During school projects students can be in partners or in groups to get a good grade. Most people think its best for kids to be in school than in their homes because it can help them in their social life, make friends in there world instead of being lonely. Students should be in schools because they should be comfortable when meeting, talking with other students because they might have things in common.

At school students can help each other out in class if they dont understand something. When I was younger I use to switch schools to schools then I went to a school called Generic_School I was the only new kid in school I had no friends I was the quite in class, then one day I join a club called book club we just read books and talked about what happen in them. When we took our test we both got A's. One day I saw a student frustrated with work so I decided to help him in America Civil War. Then one of the kids came up to me and ask what do you like I told him what I love like animals, sports. Even though lots of students like to work at home, I strongly believe its better to work at schools.

Students should have friends in there lives to be more social in the world. In my science class we have projects to do we get in a group of friends to get a good grade and we see a student work by him self",0
"Let know to the principal of all the benefits that This change will bring. Some student need to eat health because they are in school teams. Our health, depends on all of you. For example, I have Personal Fitness on my last period, when I eat my regular lunch menu, I feel tired and sometimes I don't want to do anything because I feel my body too heavy. Also, sometimes you feel tired when you are studying.                . you feel that your stomach hurts and feel that something is wrong with your body, you feel sleepy, sometimes hungry, and you can not concentrate in the class. What do you prefer, keep eating food that do not help you or food that is good for your body? Eat healthier food make your body stronger and helps you to be in good form. An healthy body, stronger, and with good aptitude. Sometimes

I don't feel good to practice,

because the food was not heath to my body or it wasn't enough. Since, when you are growing up, your body needs food that help it.

A change of the school menu could be beneficial for all of us. I think a change of the lunch menu, could be a good idea.

In my soccer team, I have practice everyday, after school. Let's make a change, for the future of all our children. My team mates told me that they bring their own food because the lunch menu of the school do not like them, and they are tired to eat the same food every single day

Some students have to go out to buy healthier food.

Another reason why the lunch menu should be change is because an healthier lunch, keeps you awake and with energy. My doctor, told me that I have to eat healthier",0
"For example, when a customer start choking, I can first aid and if that succeed, that customer will lovd this place come more often then usual. I could've go to a other place but as I am teeneger, can not go to for long distance so I choose here. But I limited the time when to stop so I do not over-play and control myself to keep playing and stay up till midnight. One of the reason you should hire me, is I was in varcity swim team at school before so I know how to team work with co-workers, and I could use team work for team for customer servise also, like if I brought wrong order for a customer, I apologize first and bring right order with some extra cutomer servise. Also, my hobby is to playing games. As conclution, I never worked before, but I have all these skills and responsbilities, you should hire me tothis place.. Clean living room, kitchen, basement, bathroom, and other rooms. I may not have experienced working before, but I will be very useful and responsible at work. Second, I al ways help my mom and do chores for her. That helps me when customer is complaining about like a table is dirty, or floor is mess, I can go there quickly and clean them fast as I could and go back to my job.

"The first one is you when your older do you want to have a good job have good money? You will always respect others,yourself and properties.

It's really important to follow those lessons because when your interviewing for a job or something like that you are gonna use those rules and life skills and show that your responsible and care about your future. when your going out with your friends like heading to the movies your gonna show the workers respect and kindness. When your older people are gonna realize how respectful you are and mature you are. I remember when I was in elementary school my teacher would always show me life lessons or lessons that would help me in life. Kindness is another example of a lesson. I still follow the lessons she gave me. That my family always taught me and others as well bacause they know others like it when you give them respect. . You guys as young kids, should follow these life lessons I will tell you",0
"For example, in the community close to the school live some families with not much resources. Should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? Conserve energy and resources through this model could be a helpfully way for the school. In other words, if the school follow this model by extending the school day two hours can conserve energy and resources and give to the community as a needs. However, following this model, by extending the school two hours would conserve energy and resources for school area and community. The school could follows this model by extending the school day two hours because it can be a helpfully way to support the school area in emergency situations. Thus, following this model, by extending the school day two hours will be a helpfully way to support emergencies situations in the school area and support community needs.. For example, at Generic_City occurred a strong earthquake at the beginning of this year. Thus, through follow the model by extending the school day two hours, the school can give necessary resources for whom need it in the community.

Second, conserve energy and resources through the model by extending the school day two hours can be helpfully for the school in emergency situations. Conserving Energy and Resources

To conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. In other hands, some people may argue that follow this model by extending the school day two hours would not be a conserve form for energy and resources because the school will still consuming this energy and resources. In other words, by extending the school day two hours and conserve energy and resources ,they were supported with this conserved energy and resources in this emergency situation. Therefore, adopting the model by extending the school day two hours can be a helpfully method to support the school area and the community.

In conclusion, to conserve energy and resources, some businesses adopted a four day work week,each day consisting of ten hours. It can be a support form for the community area. Following this model by extending the school day two hours can be method to conserve energy and resources.

First, conserve energy and resources through extend the school day two hours, the school can give necessary resources for whom need those resources in the community. They do not have money for pay the energy or buy needs as water or food. However, it can be true, but to retake my point, following this model by extending the school day two hours would conserve energy and resources. This conserve energy and resources could be a way to support the school and the community. It could be helpful for community needs and emergency situations in the school area. Generic_School was one of the school which adopted and follows the model to conserve energy and resources, as a result they were supported in their necessities in this disaster. It can be a form to give necessary resources for whom need it in the community. The only way that they can have resources as energy is through a big building as a school in the community. Thus, conserving energy and resources following the model by extending the school day two hours can be a helpfully way for emergency school situations.

Conversely, some people may claim that follow this model by extending the school day two hours would not conserve energy and resources because the school will still consuming this energy and resources with this two more hours",0
"In my opinion we choose our own character, and how we respect other people teachers, and students. My mom teach me how to behavior but she do not choose my own character, nonetheless some peoples make us strong but they don't choose own character, but on the other hand sometimes we need to change our character for example, my English teacher have a beautiful character but apart from that, sometime she need to changes her character because the students do not put attention in the classroom, and she have to be rude that way they stop talking and distract the other students, but however she never change her beautiful character.

The first step that I say that nobody choose our own character is because when we are sad nobody can change our attitude or own character somebody can try to help us but they don't gonna change our attitude because when we are sad sometimes we are angry, and our character is so bad that we don't want to do anything we just want to be alone or we just need to take a brake because maybe we are stress. My mom teach my how to behavior and that I have to respect the older peoples but she don't choose how my character it gonna be

In other words some peoples make us strong like my mom she teach me how to be strong too, and some peoples teach you that how to be strong but they don't choose how we gonna be how we gonna act, they can't teach us or change us our character we are the only person who decided If we need to change our character, however sometimes we need to change our character and that is gonna help us in the school in the house and in the life, and a person who is very respectful nice and have a good character is very important because what happened if you are angry have a bad character in the work nobody is gonna like to work with you the same happened in the school, if we have a bad character nobody is want to work with us that why sometimes is very important to change our character

The last reason but not the less important is without a doubt sometimes is important to changes our character like for example, my English teacher have some students that they don't care about the class, and she need to change her character in the class so that way the students stop talking and distracting the class, and when she change is character they stop to talk because she put angry and rude, but however she never change her character she always are happy she only change the character when the students are talking or playing in the class but they don't change the teacher character she change her own character

Nobody can change our character we decides if we change or not, sometimes it is important to make some changes to be a better person, and to help our self or to help other people, a person with a good attitude and with a good character always is gonna be good work with them we need to know when we need to change, and why we need to change and that is gonna help us for the life and for everything and always it is important to smile.. The British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote you your character will be what you yourself choose",0

"Once you've found it, you could do all sorts of things and find what's best for you. They have one thing in common is money.

Whether having a talent or just practicing, know that you're having fun whether you hate it or love it, and not for very long you will master it in no time. Different things can have an impact in your life, but that's how we all stated from very beginning; we never known we had a special talent until we try something new.. Some people have great talents, some have bad ones, but they have one thing in common is that they practice really hard to master them. You will never grow into something you want to be in the future if you don't find your inner indite. If you have done some of these, then you are ready to master a new talent. An example of this is if you're riding a bike, you fall down, but through practice you'll be riding your bike without falling off of it anymore.

We were all born with some talent that we don't know of, we just got to figure out what it is. Based on your experiences try to find something different but a little simmer.

For example, if you worked at fast food restaurant you might want to work at a store next time. The first time you won't get it so easily like you thought you would, but though lots of practice you will get it right in no time and better at it to. If you found something you're really good at, then stick with at all times, and never let that talent slip away. If it does then you will be forgetting everything, and the talent you once had, and you'll have to find a new one. No matter what they say, don't let it get in your head just focus on getting to master your talent first.

Practice makes everything perfect even if you found something new, and you want try it out",0
"As it is a waste of time to both teacher and student. If a person is not interested in something, you should not force them to like it. Classes like music, art and musics are extra activites. Students should have their own rights to choose what classes they want and what they don't want. If students are to take every classes, it might be too much for them to handle.

I believe that it is a waste of time to force those students to take classes they are not interested in. I believe that it is a waste of time to force those students to take classes they are not interested in. Studnets might like only one class and has a talent on that particular class, they should be allowed to take that particular class and does not have to take other classes. They are important and we should not neglect thoses classes. If students are to take every classes, they might loose interest in that particular class they were interested in.

Instead of forcing students to take every class, it is better to give importance to that one particular class that the studnet is interested in. But the studnets should also not be forced to take every classes. Elective Classes

I believe that classes like arts, music and drama should be elective to the studnets. Schools where they allow students to choose classes they want are likable. If a student does not want to participate in any particular class because of their personal reasons, schools should not force them to take those classes.

It is not that classes like arts, music and drama are not important to students. If they have to take every classes, it might be too much for them to handle. I believe that it is better to give importance to that one particular class that the student is interested in, than to force them to take every class. They are important for us but not that important where studnets have to be forced to take every classes. Students prefer to go to that school where they can choose classes as they want. Instead of forcing students to take every classes, it is better to give importance to that one particular class that the student is interested in.

Students should have their own rights to choose what classes they want and what they don't want. It is not required for every students to take every classe. It is not only a waste of time for students, but it is a waste of time for teachers who works so hard. They don't prefer to go to those schools where the students are forced to take every classes. Students should have their own rights to choose what classes they want and what they don't want",0
"As we know, technology has became one of the most important things in our lives, and people now are abusing the use of technology and forgetting to contact with the others around them. Besides, many poor people have been helped by the others because the news about them have been shared wide-spread. Lots of people also use it to play game, chat with their friends, or shopping online to relax after a hard-working day.

With technology, we can find and do almost things we need so we can save our times and will have more times to do the other activities like spending time with family, or hanging out with friends.

Second, technology helps us adpot hot problems, new informations of society faster and easier. If we use technology for the right purposes, and can limit the time of using it, technology will be very useful to our lives. We can complete many things online by using technology such as study, entertain, shopping, etc. For example, students use technology to serve for their learning like stuyding online or researching important things for their lessons. Although it has both positive and negative affects on people, but we cannot declaim that our lives have been easier and better since we have had techonlogy.

First, technology are used everyday by people at all ages because of its functions. We can read news on the websites, or watch the agenda to update more things everyday so we can have better knowlegde about things around us. Using technology in general and social media in particular also can help us make friends. People often use Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat to add friends over the world and follow them. We can easily contact to the others by texting, calling as technology is developing . Otherwises, we still have to speak face to face to the others as much as possible so we can understand them better, and it also shows our care to them.

Not only technology, everything in the world also has both positive and negative sides, and the main idea is ourselves. "" Has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had a positive or negative affects on people's lives?"". In short, technology can limit human contact or not based on us so let's try using it as limited as we can and don't forget to use it right ways, right times, and right purposes.. It is a best way to know our friends, family members' activities without asking because we don't have too much time to speak with them everyday. This showed the major of technology and the care of people give to the others.

Many people said the use of technology has the limitation of human contact, and it's not all right",0
"My mom always tell me "" keep going until you reach your goals, never stop"".

I believe that if we are always doing something we can accomplish more than we can imagine.

First of all, you should never give up on something, it might not work the first time but if we are working consistently on it, one day it will became a reality. Most celebrities and rich people are where they're now because they always are doing something to make their dreams true and if at one point they had stopped I don't think they would've been successful. My friend who's also in Chemistry, understood how to do those problems and much more about chemistry, so I asked her to help me. For example, when I started 11th grade I was not doing well in Chemistry. As a result, my grades improved a lot. If I'd decide to just let it passed I would've never been able to see how far I could have gotten get if I always keep trying.

Second of all, you should always go as far as you can, never stop at on point just because you think is worthless or you're are not going to make it. I remember each day getting into the class and always starting with a warm-up about moles. By always doing something and never giving up is the key to accomplish everything.

To conclude, in order to get something you should never stop working for it. With her help

I was able to do the problems on my own because she taught step by step on how to do them. If you really want to make something happen, you should always have to work for it, and not think it will just happen as a miracle.

Third of all, some people may argue that doing something over and over again will never work, however; many people are able to prove that this statement is not true. . Almost all my classmates knew how to solve them, so I was too embarrassed to ask question in front of the class. Instead, of listening to what people were saying, she worked really hard and accomplish a lot more than she could be able of. The teacher gave us about ten minutes to solve the problems because they were easy, however; I always got almost all of them wrong. For example, in a TV show about a girl who was always working toward getting into collage failed many times, but she never gave up. For example, the women who's my manager at a fast food restaurant she started as a employee. This world is full of opportunities but only those who always are working and never stopping are able to take advantage of it. Because of her hard work and desire to keep working no matter what, one day she got accepted into a really privileged collage. Most of the coworkers told her that it was going to be challenging for her to be a manager .They were trying to make her stop doing something she wanted to do for her future, they told her to just stay there and see what happens next",0
"Sometimes the people who has good skills or positive attitude in their jobs or any other occupations they have the opportunity to earn a higher position in their job. When having a conversation with another person you can learn more about anything. Also many people think they can not do it after they try the first time and did not happened how they expected. Life teaches people how to control their emotions and help those who need it. It is not going to be easy to always have a positive mind but,if the person really wants that then it will give all it's effort.. I know sometimes we have many problems and we think it not possible to have a good attitude but, there is a way how to deal with bad attitude and always have in mind the goal we want to accomplish one day.

There is always people who is going to say negative things to others instead of give them advises. Many older people or family might not want to see you fail and that is the reason for those who keep a positive attitude so they will be proud of those who protrude in life. By having a positive attitude people feel more happy and comfortable. For example,all managers have that position because they have showed that they can have a good attitude with themselves and other people. Most of the time older people or somebody you don't really know they will tell you to give all your effort and think smart. Positive attitude is the key to be successful in life. For example,when they have a positive attitude people stars to give you some advises from the experiences they have been through. By thinking and having a positive attitude people can make it become true just don not give until you have reached your goal.

In conclusion,in my opinion having a positive attitude can make people become successful in life. In life to have a positive attitude we have to know how to deal with our problems even tho sometimes we might think we can not do it but, there is always a solution and after all that has happened we learn how to have a smart thinking and not giving up.

Having a positive attitude makes people have a good communication with others. People has to keep in mind that not always everything will be easy to get and there will be obstacles in life that will make you feel that you can not get what you want. Be some educated persons and listen to what others say to them. This gives them the chance to be a successful person in life and help to become as them.

Education is also a big influence and how a person can have a good attitude and good values. Giving up would never be option for those who really have the desire to accomplish what they want. In life to become successful people needs to have a goal and a plan how they are going to accomplish that",0
"Teachers have to come home to there families too. The highers schools will have a better knowledge. Students wouldnt fail if they spent more time to learn it. Because some teacher teach it way to fast because of the sols they have to finish all of the units before sols. I think students will get a better benefit from two hours more. Only go to school four days of the week. This is important because students need time to learn the maternal. The high schooners would get to learn the maternal more, spend more time on the subject. My first reason is students will have a better education learning. Most teenagers have jobs so some of them cant stay after school. They would have a three day weekend. They would have more practice and more additives to do in class. Some students dont have rides after school. We have to be prepared for the sols but we have to take time on it learn it.

Students will have time to learn everything, therefor they wouldnt have to stay after school.

Students wouldnt have to waste teachers time after school to caught up what they messed from class. They would know the maternal on time for the sol comes, more will pass it if they understand it more.. Have time to study on the weekends.

This is why high school should extend two hours more of school. My second reason is students wouldn't have to stay after school hours to get get help, while they have extra time in class to ask any questions.

Students will have a much better understanding on the subject. They will have a better understanding. Should high schools extend the school day two hours. They would ask more questions on the topic. They need time to learn the maternal in time for the sols",0
"Fine imformation in books, magazies is harde worke and studen they do that. With the phone student can fine the imformation more faster then normal and they have more time to do others work.

Teacher will not have to worry to collect all the material that stuend use to do their work. Ibelive tha use the cell phones in the class room for educational purposes is a fantastic idea, because student will save a lot of time finding imformation or doing others works. Student by using their phone, the work is going to be more easy because phone are more practical to use.

The idea to use phones in class is a good idea because will not only helpe students it will helpe teacher too. Teachera will not worry to collect books or magazines that normaly stuednt use to fine imformation. The work will be more easy for student they wiil finish their works on time and teachers will not worry to cleand the mess the tuden do when they use books or magazine. For example, in some classes they have to fine a lot imformation classes like Goverment, Biology and World history one and two. They not going to have a escuse that why they don't finish their because with phone is going to be easy. Student to fine this imformation they use books and magazines and when bell ring the stuen live the material they were using and the teacher have to collect all the thinks that they were using, but by usin phone they will not left all that mess teacher would not worry to clean the mess.

Studen will compleate all their work because if they have a project that need to finde imfromation they will do it faster in their phone. The big reasen that student give that why they don't finish their work is that they dont have sufficient time because fine imformation in books is hard.

In conclusion phone will be a fantasctic i dea beacause will not only help stuenden it will help teachers too. Student by usin their pohe they will save a lot of time, because sametimes student have to fine imfromation for a project and project need a lot of imfromation.    . Phone are more practicle to use and more easy them books or magazine that student normaly use",0
I disagree with this statement because you are supposed to have knowledge imagination is like dreaming but when you have knowledge you can put your mind to something to create something big in the future like having your own company and you can signed workers and to make them delivered stuff to people and all of this is reality even though you need to finish school and go to college and get a degree there it take time you have to get your mind set and encourage your self to do better. You can also help people if they need help on something cause you already been threw all of this like how to get a job or how to make your own job and to encourage somebody else to just put there mind to it so that person that you helped they can also helped somebody then it goes own forever and forever and you can tell them how you succeed in they can follow in your foot step and they can tell another person who they succeed and they can tell there story imagination isnt reality it is when you are sleeping or thinking but knowledge you will need it if you are in a situation.,0
"why I says on the animals, because long time ago, I had a dog this dog was very intelligent he do every thing I tell him, but sometime he had some impression that was impossible to change. Most the time the first impression is hard to change is like a decision; when you took a decision is impossible to change, because is something the human have never goes down always up. Because all the people are not easy to get a good impression, and also are not easy to change the mind. Always I give to him good food, but something a give food that him don't liked, and his impression was very bad, always was hard that him change his impression.. this mean that the person when the have a impression about your car, picture, family, or friends they never will change the impression for them, but if the change should be impossible like a decision.

Based on my experience the first impression is impossible to change, pretty much on the humans and the animals. In my experience most the time when a impression come up to my self, it is impossible to change the mind, because if I don't like something my impression is very bad, but it is impossible to change my impression. Most the people do the same things I do, because we are people and we almost have the same feelings.

The first impression is always something has too much that we can talking. I am agree that first impressions are almost impossible to change",0
"There is where classes like this can give a little opening to reduce some of that stress. Not matter how smart a student can be but if they cannot make themselves be notice their brilliant brain will be worthless.. In life being able to express ourselves is something required, something that we have to do if we want to move keep moving up our hill path. High school the place where we can all do anything we want and just a step before going to college, or at least this is what a lot of middle schoolers think. Even if he has huge talent and the brain of a genius he will never be successful. Shouldn't school concern about them, shouldn't school be the place where they can grow and open up their winds to start flying on their sky of opportunities.

""Tu voz habre puertas"" It is something i heard from a commercial once i was watching TV with my mom, it means ""Your voice opens up doors"" but those doors will never open if we open our mouths to ask questions that will give us answers those answers will impulse us further in life. However, how can that same student later on give a speech or have the valor to push himself up in a big company if he never has learned how to properly communicate. Classes like this not only give a little time off all the stress and pressure from high classes but also can give lessons to students that they would never even imagined they would learn.

Now, think about a extremely coy student who has never had the confidence to speak up in class not even to ask a question their math class, we know we all have asked something in math is just a class that at least a question per unit seems mandatory. These classes teach the students how to socialize and communicate with others.

High school is not as easy as some would think, students usually get really stressed because they have to pass their classes, their Sols and start getting prepare for college all at the same time. In high school we take so many classes that are required and those classes are supposed to open up doors and get us closer to our goals. Who knows may be students would never think they like music but after some months taking music they would find out they love it and decide to become a musician and that can also happens with art and even drama. These classes are like a little break, just a whole class to forget about having to write an essay or doing some long math equations and, instead just have fun with friends and enjoy singing, painting and even acting. well, what about those students that do not have friends, students that always sit back in a corner and the teacher has never get him to say something. But, classes like arts, music or drama will give us something that we cannot get from others classes. That after all we do not get anything from this classes and students just see these classes as a place to hang around with friends and procrastinating for 90 minutes. Nothing will be easy but communication is a social skill we all have to learn.

Many will not agree on this and can will make strong arguments on how this classes are a waste of time. The students no one has ever heard from, or sometimes even noticed they are there. Usually the environment in this classes is always joyful and fun, it is a place where students can learn through socializing and having fun",0
"When teachers are in classes during instructional time about half the class is paying attention, the other half of the class is on their phones texting friends or updating social media and then don't know what the lesson is about when they get called on to answer questions on the board.

Phones are usually a distraction to teachers and also to the person using the phone. Cell phones is a big help it can usually download applications that you neeed to do work without being behind in certain subjects so there shouldn't be an excuses on why assignments are late, or missing and that's why cell phones are a positive affect for educational purposes as long as teachers are consistant on supervising students cell phone use.. Phones can also be a positive thing when doing paper work or projects when listening to music it can help concentrate more without getting distracted from others peers. When listening to music when you're working it gives off a positive affect on your brain, it gets your mind going with different types of ideas and keeps you from falling asleep. In case if you wanna check up on your siblings, mom, or dad even if you can notify the school about contacting your parents or your parents contacting the school it'll be easier for them to call you.

Some schools usually provide tablets for students to use so they wouldn't have to worry about loosing an assignment or turning it in late, but the majority of the time you need internet to be able to open up assignmets to turn in school students usually have tablet problems and turn it in so it could get fixed. Cell phones bring hundreds of resources that would be able to help you get answers or help you understand certain questions , meaning of words , and how to pronounce different type of sentences from other languages.

Most teachers don't allow phones or headphones in a classroom because they assume everyone's going to start texting and be on social media, cell phones are important to have close just in case of an emergency at home. Do you ever wonder if most students use their phones in school for educational purposes? In my opinion cell phone use in a classroom is not a bad thing depending weather they take advantage on getting work done or goof around the majority of the students in school take advantage of their phones about Seventy Five percent of students like to use their phones for social media and music",0
"They will enjoy their life, be happy with themselves and with the people around them, is all about how you acting, how you express yourself, and the way you talking with people, every person need make a different and show to everyone that the attitude is important to life, they will learn if the see that most of the people is doing it, try to make a different and see how everythinh is change for you. In the same time, it can open a lot of doors for you, and it can be a good opportunity for be a successful.

On the other hand, people believe that have a good attitude all the time is not a good idea, because some people will make use you, but most of the people who think like that don't have a success life; most of that people in the future feel depressing, feels like they don't do nothing with you life, they are not sucessful, and is something that every person needs thing about, you need prove that you can do it, that you can be a professional, and that you are more than people thing of you, because you need show people that is nothing imposible in life, that all your goals and dreams can makes real.

For example, a person work in a restaurant and you have a good attitude with the customers, you make them feel like in home, not waiting too long for their drinks and food, you will show them that you really happy for have them in there; in the other side, a person who works in the restaurant, don't smile to the customer, make they feel uncomfortable, and don't care about their drinks and food they don't going back to the restaurant or don't choice you for be their waitress, because you don't have a good attitude with your customers.

Also, make yourself a successful person, a person who the people want to talk, a person who a company want to you for work there, a person who do all ther goals and dreams, and a person who love himself, because you got love yourself, respect yourself, and try your best every single day, that is really impotant in your life. The attitude make you go for the best or wrong way, the best give you the best opportunity for a successful person; however, the bad give you the the work in where you do feel good, and where the best part of your day is when you go to the bathroom and use you phone for a couple minutes, when you got to life for check to check, that is the life of people who think the attitude is no the key of success, everyone don't reserve that, they reserve be happy, and have a good life with the people they love.

Is the same way in shool, talking about teacher and students, ""respect if you want respect back"", most of the students always have attitute with their teacher, they never respect them, but they want respect, a good attitude in school is the best thing we can do, because the teacher will help you more if they see you respect and really want to work, you are the person who need good grades, if you have a good attitude you will se the process in your life, in your classes, and your home. A good attitude is one of the most important things in life, because when you talking or do something with the best attitude you can see how everything is going great, and people feels good and comfortable with you. Also, in home, their parents need show and teach their kids that the attitude is the key of life, that they need have a good attitude if they want to be a good person in the future, that they want to be a professional, and be better person everyday, they will think on that, they will ask themselves why their parents try teach them that the attitude is important, and they will tray to have a good attitude for be a successul person.

In conclusion, the attitude is the key that will open all the doors you want, thats no matter what problems you have, when you do something you need doing with the best of you attitude, all is going to be perfect when you got a good attitute with people and with yourself. Try and see how your life is going for a straight way. All is based on you.",0
"Third reason, some students have some obligations in their homes, for example some of those are: pay cellphone, pay room, buy food, and pay car, so some student take advantages of the summer break to make some money to helps them to pay all their obligations in their homes, and don't take the school's time to spend it in other obligations, and take their time just to teh schools. Caming the summer break the students wait it with antusiasm, and work hard to finish the school's work and enjoy summer break, it help them as a relajation after a school's stress, they have to forget the school by a mommet, and relax their brains. Second reason, during the school's time the students does't have a lot of time to spend with their family, and the summer break is a good time of the year to spend it with their dear, persons, friends, classmate, girlfriend, and family. I am not agree with those educators that say, the summer break is too long and the students can't retain imformation as easily when they return in the fall. Finally, the student does't need the summer break shorter, they have a lot of things to do during the summer break, and it would't be justly to them, I am againt to the educators that feel the summer break is too long.. The summer break is made to a students's benefit, it help the students as a relajation during the summer. Some of them need to make money, and they take the summer break to make it. After it, the students are more prepared to star the school's year concentred at what they have to focus in the school with a clean brain ,and do all the school's work. That is why I am not agree the educators that does't wants the summer break long.

One reason,the students are in the school almost a whole year, and all that time they are stressed by all the work they have to do in the school. The students have to spend time with their family a lot as possible they can",0
"Students always seem to work harder when they get an incentive or praise. In conclusion, Praising a student's work is very important because it helps build their confidence and motivates them to work harder and smarter.. Little praises and incentives from parents and teachers are not only important for the students' performance in school but also when they transform into adults.

Additionally, another importance of praising students is the motivation for them to work harder. That is a very significant statement because every student have their own set of skills and abilities. That is because students feel appreciated for their work and it also make them feel like they are doing a good job so they always stay motivated to do better every time. Studies show that people with high self-confidence are usually risk takers,creative,optimistic,hardworking and productive. Motivation is vital for everyone because its as important as an oil is for a car. Some students are good in sports,math,science,art or music. Although it's a fair opinion, it is wrong because students who get praise from teachers and parents always seem to do better acadamically and in outside-school activities. This shows how important it is for teachers and parents to praise their students. A football manager OleGunnar Solksajer once said ""Prasing his players and kids helps them work to the best of their ability"". Self-confidence is not something that happens suddenly, it is a process that builds up from a young age. However, plenty of students are not able to perform to the best of their ability because they have low self-confidence which is mainly caused by the lack of praise and incentive by their parents,teachers or coaches. Praising a student's work is important because it helps build their confidence and motivates them to work harder.

Praising a student's work is vital for their productivity because it builds their confidence. Motivated students always work hard and give their best effort.

There are some people that think praising students will undrmine learning by lowering standards and some believe a true self-esteem and confidence comes from achievment and not from prasing. Motivation is a motor that keeps the sudents happy and hopeful",0
"As a matter of fact, the day I heard about the oportunities our school were giving to some students to be able to visit some companies. I belive I can be caplabe to do very creative work and come up with ideas in a matter of seconds to improve new producs. I believe I can apport a lot to this company.. However in my school theres not a lot of programs or clases about computer management or software programing, that could help me and other students to improve our nolage about computer Software. I absolutely want it participate, Because I want to develope more practice and skills about the job I would want to have when I get out of Collage .

Farther more, I'm very interest to work for a Microsoft company that has being my dreams sinse the day I started using computers and I would want it create something that can help others and create new technology for future Generations. Good Morning,

I just want to start this letter by telling you a little bit more about my interest towards your company . And this oportunity can help me figure out what other type of work i can be able to do.

I appreciate the oppotunities your companies are giving to our school and other schools in general, but now I would want to know if you could give me chace and the privilege to come to one of your companies and learn more about Microsoft Programing and computers. I would want to learn more and get more experience about crearting and fixing computers.

For sure woking at a Microsoft company is what I want to do for a living. Also allowing me to come and visit one of the companies would help me undertand what I'm going to be facing in the future when I start working for a big company

For example, what is exactly the job I'm going to be doing or what job I be able do enjoy doing , or what is going to take to get there etc.

If you allow me this oportunity I can show you my skills and you can see and judge me by my job or what I can do",0
"Me and my science class will be doing it this year i am happy to do it becaue i never mixed chemicals or never put on science goggles. They can be fun because you get to do alot of things with them. i cant wait to do it this year we will be doing chemisry in april. In this new year that we are now there are thosands of enjoyable and educational activitys. It is fun because i used to play an insturment the last three years and it was fun because you get to go to trips. Mixing chemicals can be hard and scary because what happens if you mix the chemcals and something happens in chemistry you have to be very careful with what chemicals are you mixing together.

I am very happy because you have thosands or hundres of activitys to choose from because their are alot of people who are loking for a good and fun activity. nI really loved that activity because you learn more and become good at it.

Another activity that can be fun and cool and enjoyable is playing an insturment. We went with the orchestra class, band, and even chores. These activitys should be done because they are very fun.

An activity can be fun is like playing a sport their are alot of sports out there that can be fun and aggresive but its exciting to play a sport because you get to go on trips and you get to verse other teams or with only one player. you get to even become a professional player

I played soccer for about two years and now i am good at it. Before in elemantary school i used to be bad at it and used to say ""im bad at this"" or ill say ""im not good at it"" but then i entered in a summer soccer program every evening or in the day i would go to a school and we would go to a soccer field. Last year me and my friends went to Generic_City. it was fun. And the fun part is that you get to be in a stage with your friends and play music infront of the audiance.

Another enjoyable activity is chemistry its fun because you get to mix different chemicals to objects or chemical to chemical. and its nice to play an insrument because you have alot of oppsions to choose from and you even get to play nice soothing music or loud and extreame. so i recommend you to go look for an activity that fits yoou right and that enjoyable and educational.",0
"It is well informed that people can be complicated but nobody will said the life will be easy all the time. Be your own and value every single thing that is around, but remember nothing is easy life can surprise you anytime.

In conclusion, people should start making their own decisions to be aware of what life really is if your learned and have a better understanding about life in a daily routine anything that will happen will not surprise you. Loving yourself will make you love others. I think people should start making their own decision because, they can learn about life, have a better understanding on how life works and how to value their-self and be efficient person on their own.

However, there is a big chance that people can tell you how you really should live your life, you have to experienced it in persons there will be a day when you are going to fall or something can happen you are not aware on how life can be so hard and difficult in times. The humanity now in days had been not so good lately, there is many different opinions on how you should do things in life or how you should act. Hopefully people will take a note that life is all about you and not others each person has a different thoughts and ways of seen life. Also mistakes are allow nobody is perfect life will surprise you anytime without you notice it you got to be ready to face it not matter how easy or hard it could be. In addition anything you do will not make others happy you have to learn to do everything on your own because that more efficient you are the more good things in life you will make. Anything that will hurt you will make you strong and that's how you know that your are living life.

Lastly, people might not notice it but if we do not love ourselves nobody will do it, people do have to depend on some else to be happy it's all about you. When you make your owns decision you will be capable of making the right decision for yourself.

Meanwhile, it is hard to understand life sometimes but is part of our daily life and you have to understand how it really works so the way you do not stress out for a simple thing, life gives you challenges that only you as the only responsible of yourself have to face it and all will depends how you take things it will be a result of it. . As we grow life will make us stronger or weak it all depends but best choice of making the right thing is that you should be aware that anything can happen without given you a hint it will hit you on the right time or not on the best time you wanted it",0
"Attitudes like this can lead to: not meeting up with deadlines, missing daily classworks, poor understanding skills, and ultimately failure. It is true that most students have no problem with this , they complete their agenda and assignments; Thus why they are more comfortable with this method of learning. It is possible that due to a lack of connection with the Teacher in the classroom and the student, it is most likely they would not have the chance to ask further questions or recieve reliable advices from a teacher. Students that have poor learning skills would be incompetant to take online classes, Which mean at all costs their must be guidance for this kind of students. I oppose the idea of schools offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes,this is because not all students benefit from attending classes from home,and online.

Giving students the choice to attend classes online is a big responsibility; Causing the demand that they must follow instructions,and complete class work tasks. But this method of learning is not always the case for some students, because it gives this students an opportunity to become nonchalant about their classes; Consequently, they start to fool around and get distracted at times. In some cases students can benefit from seeking assurance from other students with more knowlegde about the subject, group activites ,and asistance.

In conclusion, distance learning and it's method of teaching is not helpful to every student, because a stystem of learning that benefits all students,and give students opportunity for futher understanding is more beneficial.",0
"he also created his own Tennis league in Spainh. He always was getting better and better every year.    . He is a famous soccer player. An example of this is Leonel Messi. I always try to do my best to leard different sports. In conclution if someone wants to grow more as a person. I believe that Ralph Waldo Emerson is right. They are the best in what they mastered, but they don't have any type of knowledge in other thing. he also become a busines man. He will has to try different things to get more experience and more knowledge. he is a soccer. Pique also support a fundation that his wife created to help kids in Colombia.

Other example is one of my uncles from Generic_City. He was very happy with his work, but to grow more and get more knowledge he go back to college to study to become a doctor. Now Pique have a lot of companies that work for him. he get pay a lot of money, but to grow more as a person. He grow as a person by doing what he already mastered.

people have to do different things in their life's if they want to grow as a person because if they think they are the best is a lie. If a person mastered something already he will feel that he know everything but the true is that he only know whay he mastered, but if a pereson try different thing he would get more experience that can be use in the future.

an example of this is Pique. he never play other sport in his life's. his mane is Generic_Name. If someone wants to grow more as a person, they will have to try different things. Now he is considere one of the best player in the world. I also like to to study a lot for the classes that I'm having problems because I get more knowledge about different topics and make me grow more as a student

.

People can still growing when they mastered something. I'm a really good soccer player, but I prefere to try others sports. To grow more as a person people have to try different things because the most things they do the more experience they get. I play a different sport everyday because I feel that this will help me to become a better player and will give me the experience to grow more as a athlete. He study to be a teacher. Now he feel like he know more and that he have grow more as a person.

I also like to thing that I'm a example of this. he has play soccer all his life's",0
"You have to go through the rain to get to the rainbow, you have to be prepared for the big situtions that are coming your way. Although some say ""Unless you have try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Based on my experiences I do agree to Emerson's statement because life isn't easy you have to try new things in life, you have to risk yourself to walk through that bigger path and try not to look back to something you couldn't accomplish back than, instead look up, stand striaght and tell yourself ""I know I can master new/harder things that are to come my way.""

Some say if ""You don't try to do something beyond what you have already mastered you will never grow."" How are you suppose to grow if you haven't master something you can't accomplish? Life puts us in a sitution where not everything is going to be perfect, not everything is going to be rainbows and butterflies you have to challange youself, you have to show everyone that just cause you messed up once doesn't mean your going to make the same mistake again. Instead you should do the opposite and tell yourself that you are better than what you think you is and that your going to master lots of things with or without someone by your side telling you ""You can do it."" This is my side of the statement I agree with and the way I look at things when I feel like I can't master big/small situtions. Take a deep breath and I promise that at the end of the day you'll be happy because you master something you thoght you couldn't handle, but not only that you'll be happy because you didn't give up and you showed all these people that didn't beileve in you that you did it!

Others say that ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" I agree with this side of the argument because it's honestly the truth you have to master new things or you'll never see yourself growing, for an example if you just had an argument with your sigificate other and you break up with him/her your really just throwing things down the drain instead of sitting down to talk to that person to try to solve what went wrong.                         . Don't let smaller things effect you at the end of the day the sun is still shinny brighter than ever, challange yourself so you can master and accomplish the situtions.

Therefore if you can't accomplish something you've tried so much you shouldn't give up but also don't stress about it too much either. You have to learn how to handle the bigger situiton to know how to handle the smaller sitution when it comes to you. If you think what your doing is the best than don't look back and keep doing what you've already started, life will be harder sometimes but it's up to you to show that you can master things you haven't been through. Maybe that was the first break up and he/she actually wants to break up, are you going to let her/him to let you go just like that or are you going to ask him/her for a reason? Get on their shoes, sometimes things happen for a reason and if what ever your going through hits you in the back of the head is for a reaon, don't confuse yourself on accomplishing something and showing off.

In conclusion some things might be harder for you than others but you shouldn't end up backing up and telling yourself you can't do it, that it's too hard. People might think you can't handle what your going through, people will laugh at you for not being able to master something that is easy for them but harder for you, you can't just stop trying just because you feel like you can't no more. Try to master things so you grow not just kick things down the road and think that their going to come back to you",0
"People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person.

Because technology makes people to become more single, we can do a work or we can finish something by ourself. For example, if I want to buy a book for my friends that he live very far from me. Technologyy allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. Technology

I think has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive on people' live. It is not a good things for us. So how can we find a way to use less time to do the work? Technology will help us.

People do not need contact work together. We need cost more time. We can use the less time to do more work.

So that is why I think has the limtation of human contact due to the use of technongy had positive on people's live.. It save many time and improve the work. I just need to wait a few days and then he can get the book. Right now I can buy a book online and then I type his address to delivery. I do not need to go to the bookstore buy a book then call him ask him when does he have time, and we make a time to meet each other. This is the technology makes life more confortable.

If today we do not have technology, maybe we need many people to do for one work. Time is important, in fact, we do not have too much time in our life, we need to ues the less time to finish one thing",0
"Yes,we accomplish more if we are always doing something rather that doing inactivity. We can see their hard work and dedication really worth it as it is one of the most beautiful city among the world. Hard work and dedication always lead us towards the success so does if we are always doing something to accomplish the task. Would it have been possible if they were doing inactivity? Obvioulsy no nah? Doesn't it sound foolish that inactivity also serve the purpose. No one want to rush to complete any task at the due time so we should be always doing somehing to accomplish more. It somehow can help to accomplish taking much time but not the same way like if we are always doing somethng.

There is a famous saying that ""Rome was not built in a day"". From tortoise side,like topic says we should be always doing something to accomplish more or in time in the same way tortoise kept on walking for the race although he can't run having faith in himself that he can do it. Our continious work to accomplish any task will be paid later by our better results. It somehow can can help to accomplish taking much time but not the same way like if we are always doing somethng. Now all of us what the result gonna come. Doesn't it sound foolish that inactivity also serve the purpose. We should always respect your competetors thinking that they are as stronger as you and keep doing our assesments to be the most deserving one of that victory. Slow and steady always wins the race but it doen't mean to say that doing work slowly will worth it everytime. if two students are assigned a long project in the summer vacation and one student started working from the mean day so that it will be easier from him to complete before the due date whereas the other one kept on realxing thinking that he will start working on it at the last of vacation. One student happily submitted the project accomplishing it before the due date and the other one had to suffer a lot. As ""Where there is will there is the way"" in the same way if we really want something then we can achieve it if we keep on working and always do something for that. Here the people were always working for many years to built Rome into a beautiful city. I mean that you should be always doing something in oder to accomplish in time. Time is the most important key factor in our life. I can support it by saying that failure will never ever take you if your determination towards success is strong enough and keep workng for it.

Let's take an example of two students. We can learn lesson from tortoise and rabbit story. We should have strong believe in ourselves that I can do it then nothing seems impossible.

In conclusion,last but the least I would like to end up saying that if we are always doing something then we can accomplish more compare to the one who works inactively. From rabbit side we shouldn't do mistake to think our competetors not strong enough than you. Once it is gone it is gone for forever..So,the key point is we should understand the importance of time and utilize it properly and make it effective by always doing something which leads us to the accomplishment of our task.. If we keep on doing something to accomplish it then victory is always near to us. So which one would you prefer accomplishing by always doing something in the right time or rushing to complete task in due time.

So,in my opinion always doing something to accompish more is better idea than thinking that inactivity also serve a purpose",0
"They can doing something like in his home or a thing easy that they can make, for follow living but some people something just think about what they want to make his purpose but they never do something.

Second, People can follow his purpose and doing something wonderful, but if they do not are idle for example in some works like that people who work. Also be a wonderful person in jobs like restaurant help to have more client but depend how the people serve.       . So first to all we accomplish more if we are always doing something for ours life and do not do bad things that do not help for what to accomplish so we need to think first the things and glide that things what we want to do. in some place the boss are idle and that do that people leave that job for his idle personality it is wonderful if people do something good for his life because, some people do things bad and that happen that in some place never proposed something.

Third, In some place or country are bad, because people do not accomplish to have a good country because they do not do something good, for example something steal person, and happen that country accomplish a purpose we need to accomplish what we can or what we what for ours life, and do not be idle because are idle do not help for make something better for ours life, so we need to have patience with want we accomplish.

We need to doing something good for examples, people that work in office need to be amiable with people that need something most of the people who work in office do not have to be idle. Thomas Jefferson wrote determine never to be idle, it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something, people can accomplish if we are always doing something, people can follow his purpose what they want because all people can done with want they accomplish in ours life its many things that can we do something.

First, People like to be idle with other people like in some works when they do not want to employed in his works just because they have a inability personal but if people want to accomplish",0
"i would like to have my work experience with a group. and working with people can also make u grow not physical but to grow as a person and to make u more mature and to make u have a better understanding of life and of your responsibilities. and also working with a group can be very beneficial. its can also be very important when you have your teamates around you that if there is any mistake you and your teamates can come together and try to solve that issue. so i feel that as a young adult comming up in this world. because working with a group can also makes u feel confident and makes you good at social interactions. so that when u go out in the world you already know how to interact with your boss and fellow coworkers. I think that working with a group is way better, because working with a group gives you a better understanding of what you are doing and helps you to be more focus. that way i can be more aware,focus and to be more understanding of my environment that im working in and that i can learn not just from my self but learn from the people around me.

Working with a group can also be fun you can work with kids your age or you can work with people older than you. and also working with a group can improve on manners, behaviour,self esteem, self conduct and politeness. working in group is very important you can have experience and learn alot from other people it also teaches you what to expect and how to prepared for it in the future. it can teach you self awareness,kindness towards others and its can influence you in so many ways because if you are working with people older than you are going to start acting more mature and want to live up to your teamates expectations. it also teaches you how to act around others and teaches you the importance of life so i think that working with a group is better it teaches you better and you can learn better.

"     . That's why I think is nice to get classes at school and I think is not so good to take classes at home because you can get more fun at school and is a experince that you will never forget.

In another part if you did not want to get school because someboby bother you like if another student tell you a nickname that you di not like maybe can be a reason that you did not want came to school but you can took with you adviser or your's parents because every body have a opportunity to be at school and anybody can't tell you anything. Do you think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

I don't think the students would get benefits from being able to attend clasess from home. For example: if the student take oline classes and watch videos conferencing maybe will be boring and the studend get stress in another part if the student take the classes at school he be with friends or somebody to talk. Second, the student who takes oline classes will not have any friends or somebody to talk. For example: if the student don't want to do what the student have to do no body tells nothing. Finally, if you take the classes at home and never came to school you cannot live the experinces that we live at school. For example: Everybody want any friend or somebody who can we talk if you do stay at home you never meet someone and never know somebody. Next, if the student stay at home the student can do whatever the student want to do. First, the students not have somebody like a teacher to tell what to do and no body give pressuare. Third, the student maybe can get frustate to be lonely at home. For example: if you take a classes at home you cannot participate in any activity that the school have like a any sport or party or any activity that one is so funny and you can enjoy the activities with you friend or teachers who always are there for us to lisen if you have any problem and the techer are like a secret box because you can tell whatever you want and they never tell to someone. For example: if the student want to play video games the student can do that and if the student want to sleep he can do that too because the student will not feel with any responsability also, if the student wants to go outside he can do that because the student will be at home and maybe their parents work all day",0
"There are more examples the happens and real life to many people.

In conclusion, technology can be good or bad, but thats depends on the manner of how the people wants to use it. The Psychologist Generic_Name said that ""it is better have conversations face to face because people can be more clearly about situations"", and he is right because using technology people can lie behind the screen. Otherwise parents can go out with them instated of using technology.

Also, many people believe that technology is bad because technology has more important people behind a screen than people around them. Moreover, about ninety percent of all the people paid more attention to the technology than their families, or people around them. When this teacher ask her about if they can do a video call she said not because she was lying to her. In 1978 people were more respectful and some of them did not study but they show the respect to each other. Sometimes I think that is her parents fault because they still keep buying many technology things. Although some people say that technology is good because all the people can use it for an emergency situation, actually many people believe that technology can change the attitude of the people and technology has more important people behind a screen than people around them.

Although some people say that technology is good because all the people can use it for an emergency situation. Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. Further, in this situation is very necessary the technology because they can be in a very hard situation. Technology does not stop increasing, yet people have to know how to use it in the appropriate moment and the correct form. For example, I know this families that have a girl that is fifteen years old, and she likes to see many TV shows. It is true the some people the use technology constantly they can get mental problems or they get blind using technology over and over. Her conduct is very bad, but that is the way her parents are growing her. This girl goes out whatever she wants and with whatever she wants. For example, when I was in my country many families were living faraway from the city, and some of them did not have any device to communicate with their families or another person; however, some of them were having a really hard lives because sometimes they got sick and they did not have the help from others and they died because the technology was necessary by the moment.

In addition, many people believe that technology is bad because technology can change the attitude of the people. However, people keeps saying that a person change the attitude because of: movies, music, novels, and cartoons. It is true that many people are more focus on a screen almost all the time. For example, people can check out books, they can do shopping from online, and play games without speaking to another person. There is one example about lying while using technology, about five months ago I was reading this book that is call ""

Behind the Wed

"" and was very interested because the character was a woman teacher that was having communication with someone that she did not know nothing about it; however, when they were sending messages the person the was behind was acting the was a man but was a girl acting like a man. This young girl acts like she is more older than other teenagers because she does not obey to her parents. By this time factories create more devices that makes more people loose their mind in technology. By contrast, allowing children using technology at young age is very bad because some of then do not use it appropriate, and when they get older their parents can not control them because they learn many bad things from the technology. Imaging that a family lives faraway from us and need help and nobody lives around this family.  . Technology can change the life of many people. They do not paid attention to how their daughter is using the technology. However the technology had positive and negative effects on people's lives",0
"That's how winner is done.

In summary all the proofs plays an important factor in how to be successful in life, sometimes is that shove that you needed to get higher. We all passed through that situation , you feel like you're not lace in, in the directions that your boss or supervisor gave it to you to do and thanks to that some employees start laugh at you, about your failure and no one is loyal to come up to you and teaches you how to do it they stand by and wait until they see that you made it wrong then they try to help you. But, it does't care how it hits, the only thing that really cares is about how much you can take, how much you can get hit and keep moving forward. Not you, not me, even no one hits that hard like life does. Eventhough failure plays an important role in the pursuit of success. Success consists of going from failure to failure until you get what you're being fighting for, without losing your enthusiasm. But, let me tell you something that you already know, the world isn't a rainbow it's a very mean and nasty place and it doesn't matter how rude you are, it would put you into your knees and keep it permanently if you let it. Company Association, Churches, and Governments are not alike as before, because now if you are trying to achieve something and for some reason you failed, people will start judge on your acts that you're not capable to become your dreams reals. In my opinion, i completely agree with this association church statement. However i realized that the time period it's not the same to the one that we're living on. I would like to share one specific example that fail is the promotion that brings you to success.

I would like to lasso the example of your first day on your new job. In addition to this, you have to be able to hold out the criticisms of others, if you are not capable your enthusiasm will get shrink and all the effort would be vainly.. If you know what you worth, then go out and get what you worth, but you must have to be able to hold out hits and not to came and blame others and say; I can't be the person that i want to be, because of him or her, or anybody",0
"also, they say when the person loss the first two times they're losers, stupy persons, or other bad things that are not right. Moreover, this year my aunt was trying to travel to El salvador, but when she called to the airline for buying the ticket, the tickets were so spends and she doesn't have to much money, so she decided to wait few months. in conclusion, for being successful we have to fall out in the life, like when i fall out my test and with my aunt cause. For example, when I took my English test last year in my English class. . Churchill's statement of success consists of going to failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm is more than true because anybody is perfect and we need to fall out for learn lessons and learn to be stronger persons in the life. I practiced a lot and I did my best for taking A+ or maybe B+, but I did pass the test. So, I took it and this time I passed with A-, I was so excited. To fall out the test made me to understand that it doesn't matter how many times we can fall out about what we want, we only need to be strong and try as much as we can for being successful. even thoug she can't travel yet, she doesn't lose her enthusiasm of travel this year to my country. I was very sad, however, my teacher told me that I had a second chance. My aunt was sad because she did not remember about to renew her documents, but she went to renew her documents some weeks later and after that she has to wait at less three months to receive the new ID. in my oponion this cause happend to them or they are saing that because they loss their enthusiams and become weak person. this teach to everyone to be stronger person and never lose their enthusiams of be successful in each persons life. some people think this statement is not true because some of them loss multiple times for being successful in their life. Do you agree with ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm, yes or not? I agree with Churchill's statement of success consists of going to failure to failure without loss of enthusiams because not all the time we can win or make the things perfect. at this time the three months already pass and she didn't receive her ID, she's really sad because she wants to go visit my grandmother. seven month ago she called again to the airline and the prices tickests increase more money, but she didn't want to continue waiting more time so she decided to buy it, when she was buying the tickets the person told to her of her ID was already expire, so she can not buy the ticket",0
"Never feel bad that you showed the haters that you can do it. I can't lie I really miss him and I really wish I could give him a big hug. When i cried because my mom was not with me and my father would not let me see her that showd me that my head was up all ready because I fighted to be with her. All those hater will always want to see you crying,mad, and sad and they also want you to feel like a big losser, all those haters turn them into your motivators, don't let them put you down. Stay strong and never forget that you are better, and stronger then that problem. I took a chance to live with my mom and now I am happy with her.

Hard problems make you build up strength on yourself. Always keep your head up high and never down because, keeping it down won't help at all.

A problem is a chance for you to do your best. A problem Is a chance for you to do your best.

Did you know that problems are a chance for you to do your best.

Problems builds up strength on you. My problems opened up so many chances for me to do my best in life. Always put a positve thinking and everything will come out positive and you will feel motivated to keep fighting.

Really hard problems help you keep your head up and learn to never give up on a really hard war. I have turned all my haters into my motivators, because I wanted to show them that I can do it . I will never forget him and will always love him beause he is my father. Always have a smile on you face, my mother told me ''even if you are upset always have a smile because, you have to smile to the hard world you are in."" That's why I agree that a problem is a chance for you to do your best. It has also showed me to never put a negitve thinking and put a positive thinking, because if you but a negitive thinking everything could come up negitive and you will always try to give up if everything comes out negitive. When my father was so mean to me I would always put my head up and not let the mean words get me down. Hard times like problems help you to keep your head up and never give up on a hard war.

A problem is a chance for you to do your best. Never give up of your problems, whatever problem you or your familly are going through never give up, because if you give up you won't be able to go to the past and change up everything that you gave up on. My hard problems have showed me to not repeat the past and to do better then the past because, I would always try to give up on everything and always put a negitive thinking to my problems. Never lose that one chance in life. Those chances will not come back and you will regret not taking the chances. When my father abandoned me and my sisters, it build up strength on me and my sisters because, we had to learn that are father is not always going to be there when we want him to be there and we have learned that we don't need a father for everthing and we can do it by ourselfs. All that is left are the good memories I made with him. To never give up and show him and the haters that I am stronger and better.        . They are also helpful for you in your life because, they make you strong, so when you have an other problem it won't hurt you as much. This has showed me when you try to give up you are showing yourselfs and others that you are weak and can't handel it. Problems will always have a chance for you, so you can do better in your life. All the tears I have cried over him have build up strength on me and thought me to never give up and keep fighting even if it is hard for me.

Hard issues show you to not repeat the past and do better then the past. They also show you to not repeat the past",0
"Also studies have shown that making kids do a extra activity can contain a lot of stress and who wants to be stressing I know I don't, and it can also contain kids losing sleep do to the activities if they have homework and a activity to do it'll make the students lose sleep due to the activity and the brain needs a good hours of sleep for it to function well. This is why I say principals shoudn't make students join activies

Secondly, I disagree with the principal because the students will get way more tired faster and did you know that someone in Washington DC, fainted due to the principal making the student do a other activity and thats why the principals shouldn't make students join a other activity because it'll most likely make them get tired faster and what we want is to keep our kids healthy but we can't keep them healthy if the principal makes them join a activity.

Lastly,my last reason is stress, stress can come from a lot of things like work,school,friends,parents,children as you see stress comes from a lot and school stress is a big oe because we all know sometimes our grades go down and when we try to bring them up it gets really stressful and espcially if your pricipal is making you do a other activity that'll make even more stress and multiple studies have shown that a lot of the stress that kids get is from school and other activies. I disagree with the principal saying that all kids should at least join one extracurricum activity because kids have other things to do like homework,they might be already doing a activity and they'll get tired faster if the principal make them do a other activity, and it can contain stress if you don't get it right the first time.

For and foremost, I disagree with the principal saying that all kids should at least join one extracurricum activity because the student have homework to do and I know that i get a lot of homework maybe you do too i also know teachers give kids projects and if the principal makes them do a extra activity then they wont be able to have anytime to do their own things. Those were all of my reasons on why the principal shouldn't mame students do a other activity . Those were all of my reason on why the principal shouldn't make students join a other activity espcially if they don't want too.

Overall,I disagree with the principal making students do a other actvity because of homework,losing sleep faster and last but not least is stress",0
"But there are way more instruments than just the piano.

A saxophone is fun to use and its kind of similar to a piano according to the similarity of what music type the instrument is used on, except for rock, rap, and maybe orchestra. This is another type of guitar that people really like the rhythm and can listen to it nonstop. It has guitar, trumpet, flute, clarinet, and even a saxophone for a different sound for the keys just for the people who want to change their style. The acoustic guitar is one of the most calm sounding guitars in the world because it is used to make sad music and also relaxing. Playing an instrument is fun because it can a hobby for the people who are just starting. Pianos requires a great amount of practice and knowing all the keys to create a good music at a play with the audience amused. Next, the distorted guitar is mostly well known by rock and heavy metal. This guitar is fun to use by learning how to know which strings you should use first in order to make a good song or music with a acoustic guitar in the background. These three types of guitars are very different and attracts people's taste of music because some people are different.. Next, the saxophone is similar to a trumpet, trombone, and tuba by blowing on the top part of the saxophone and at the same time using your both of your hands to make a rhythm. But if you master a saxophone, thats where the fun part starts. Professional piano players gets most people's attention by knowing the right keys for the music that the piano players are playing. But thats what heavy metal fans like such as Intensity. And you can also be well known for doing those kinds of stuff. In addition, There are many tutorials of how to play the piano and learning the right key on social media to begin or improve your piano skills, due to technology. However, an electric piano has more than 20 buttons of instruments to choose from. But, there is a last instrument that is really famous and also really fun to use.

There are different types of guitars to choose from dealing with music. These guitars need to be plugged on an amplifier for it to work and they are loud. The saxophone is famously known by smooth jazz, jazz, and night jazz and night jazz are commonly used in New York cafes at night and other states. The clean guitar is mostly used for country music and soft rock. For example, A piano is used for many types of music. It takes a couple of years to practice for beginners or couple of months to practice a new music for experts. In addition, Saxophones can be taught in music class in middle school, high school, or just a music school in general. But sometimes Smooth jazz with a piano in the background is played at a cafe and restaurants to relief the stress that people are having in their personal lives. As a result, Pianos has been used frequently in the 1960's for music and people still listen to it everyday in the radio in their automobile. Such as Smooth jazz, Rock, Orchestra, Rap and much more. You can create relaxing jazz instrumentals for people to listen to for meditation and stress relieving",0
"Some people t don't like speaking in front of a large group of people this can be a problem in their lives. These shows how sometimes you have to take advantage of something an use it as something to try your best on.

Although sometimes we might experience difficulties while trying to solve that problem in our lives we just have to keep on giving it our best to overcome it. I believe that there a lot of problems that we can learn from because sometimes while trying to solve those problems we make mistakes and we can learn form those mistakes and move on. Completing a group project, homework, or writing an essay are one of the few examples that can represent how sometimes it doesn't matter how big the problem is we must try our best. . Finishing a group project, homework might seem as though it would be something that could be completed without difficulty it does take a bit of an effort for some people. These people try hard to overcome a problem that is stopping them from doing certain things.

All of this examples represent how sometimes we're faced with problems that can be difficult to let go off. These people have to be able to control their nervousness, something that could be hard to control. I think that the meaning of the quote is something important as it can apply to certain situations that are rather difficult. The American jazz legend Duke Ellington said ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" I believe that the meaning that this quote was trying to convey is that when we are faced with a problem it does not matter how challenging that problem is we must use it as a chance try our best. To overcome these problem athletes train a lot and use it as an opportunity to train and rest more to be in a good condition before finally playing with the rest of their team. These injuries are not easy to recover from as it could damage a part of their body that could possibly prevent them from playing for some time. Sometimes a lot of things can happen unexpectedly but we must believe in ourselves that a problem could be an opportunity to try our best, it might also prepare us for bigger problems in the future. For example athletes, athletes sometimes sustain injuries while playing and have to recover. Occasionally we encounter difficulties while trying to find the solution to a problem in our lives an example of this could be having to give a speech in front of a large audience. Although sometimes we might experience difficulties while trying to solve that problem in our lives we just have to keep on giving it our best to overcome it.

When we are faced with a problem it does not matter how challenging the problem is we must use it as a chance to try our best. I agree with this quote ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"" I think its describes how sometimes we need somethings to happen in life that will makes us want to try harder to achieve our goals. This might apply to people that are still in school but being responsible and completing all of this work might prepare them for their future careers.

Sometimes a lot of things can happen unexpectedly but we must believe in ourselves that a problem could be an opportunity to try our best, it might also prepare us for bigger problems in the future. This quote shows us how sometimes there a certain problems in our lives that can be very difficult but we should try hard and do our best. However these people keep on trying because they want a good grade or don't want to fail class",0
"should people make their own decisions, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matter? one of the common questions i get ask. For example people can learn from there dicision but in other hand listening to people's advice can stop you from doing wrong. Making your own decision can make you more independent and know how life works and those are the people we look up too. . Depending on the situation your in listening to others give us life lesson can be one of the most unforgetables momments because that show you they care and want the best for you because maybe they didnt end up making the right decision and want you to prevent from doing it . Ever since i was little i always wanted to make my own decision and wont have to listen to no one but i the more i got older i realized that sometimes what people say to do can turn out to be better then the decision you took. Many people have different thoughts about this questions,

my opinion is depending the sittuation",0
"It really hard to teach young kinds because some older student don't even remember the work from any grade like me some time time my little sister be like can you please help me in be like am sorry dont even remember it really difficult to teach a young student. I don't understand her nothing at all but I think because different language but asking some else in the program she explain the easy way i cant understand her.

4. Like some time i explain my sister what is bad but some time i don't know so I ask in adult to explain me really well that how in school work to young kinds may not really get the older kinds a younger need a adult to understand it well.

3.I go to a program is about math but i really understand because we share opinions of different work they do like student have com plenty different work they have it the hard way in the easy way student get more confused when they have com plenty different work like my math teacher I have different completely different work. talking with some one like your age understand it all of us have different kind of ways to explain it in to learn it. Older kinds have difficult time to teach young kinds they have different way that there teacher teach them how to there work. The most important is if the young student get it if they don't get it they will fell the test because the older one properly know but can explain can find the easy way so the student can understand it really understand it good they really more information how to treat the student in explain it good make sure it good to them make sure not to just yell at them you have to have passion. paying attention is really good thing so the student can really get the work they can get in learn what they do. Many kinds can't understand because the different subject.Young student don't really get the work that older kinds do. Student can""t really get it they need some one to be beside them in tell them or teach them I really wonder if there were only one student or a lot because is program but if it was only one person they really can concentrate that really good because there a lot lot if there was more than one person it fine because it will be more help that the main effect if there was only one person in not a lot of them in was a big problem with then.if there were talking to much it was big problem for the program.

5.    . Like me I understand it with a adult like PROPER_NAME that one my teacher i can listen to him but some with younger them me or alder them me. It really hard to know there work in explain the way we explain the kinds the better they understand what they supposed to do.We have to have a lot of passion to do it.

2.I think many student don't really get it because they older student some student don't really get it some of them dont get it fast but some of them need more extra work with it.Older student some time they explain good more then the teacher but for me it better in adult because will ask question in they know well because they teacher. 1",0
"To think and, analize our point of views and,ideas.

""Determine to never be Idle"" (meaning lazy) I know there's time when we all want to be lazy and not doing nothing, but thats not get you no where near your Goals. This is all i have to say about my prompt.. it helps you to be more prepare and organize and. ready for everything. Always have a mindset goal, realistic goals, and measurable.

We do Accomplish more if we're doing something, keeping yourself occupied. Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to idle...

It is wonderful how much may be done.

If we are always ."" Do what we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose.

I try to do my best to Accomplish everything, i can as fast i can to catch up. As Thomas Jefferson said "" It's Wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing"".

Thomas Jefferson has an amazing point with this Qoute.

This qoute Has alot of meanful information behind it, and i think everyone

Has a their own way to learns about it.

Not any person create a good qoute mostly, Qoute are written or said by people Whom were Famous , or made a great impact in our world, and, they're always going to be remember as the person and their story. Not being active its not good nor healthy, and It wouldn't help you progress in future reference.

"You are going to come late from school which means that you are not going to be able to play. On Wednesday Generic_Name needs to go to the after school club, also he has Basketball practice after the club. Also, Generic_Name just bought a game and he can only play on the weekends. For example, Generic_Name

plays Basketball but he goes to an after school club for English class. This proves that after school club can affect the sport that you play. For example, Generic_Name is a gamer on YouTube he streams every day and plays games for YouTube, but now that he has to go to after school club he can't stream on week days because he gets out of school at 6:30 and the drive home is 30 minutes. This proves that after school can affect on family time. PROPER_NAME tried to convince the coach that he was at a club for school, the coach told Generic_Name """"Is either school or Basketball Generic_Name."" Generic_Name got kicked form the team because he got to strike three. He lost lots of people that were following him on YouTube just because homework club. Do you want to be board going extra hours to school, when you could be doing fun things? All the sports that you want to do will be ruined if you do homework club. If you like doing sports do it because you should do homework at your own time. Generic_Name was playing for YouTube and had

a lot of people on his stream and lost half of them because after school club.

After school homework club is a waste of time, if you have things to do after school. So, Generic_Name gets home at 7:00 and he needs to do some of the home work that he didn't got to do on the club and is to late for him. For example, Generic_Name is at school and the day is over but, he needs to go to after school club. If youre in after school club and your parents are planning to go eat dinner, you are not going to make it. If you are in after school club and in a sport your most likely going to be late for your favorite sport. Generic_Name call his mother and told her "" Mom i need to stay after school today"" but, his mother told him ""we were going to your favorite restaurant Red Lobster."" Generic_Name upset that we wont be able to go to his favorite restaurant because of after school club. Don't do after school homework club if you don't want extra time in school. Generic_Name got kicked from the sport that he loved, and the sport that he though that was going to be his career.

Finally, if you like video games their is only video games

on the weekend if take this club. Generic_Name goes to practice and he is five minutes late the coach tells him that is strike one. If you do after school homework club in school for more hours. Students should not have after school homework club because you won't have time to spent with family members, students are not going to have time to play there favorite sports, and they won't be able to play their favorite sport.

First of all, students won't spend time with their family. Generic_Name missed his favorite restaurant

just because school.

Secondly, students won't be able to play sports. It's difficult to do two things at once so don't do after school club.                            ",0
"For example, when I was little, my biggest dream was to be with my parents one more time as a family, we were separated at that time; I was in my home country, El Salvador and they here in the United States. We can make plans for every goal in life, but it doesn't matter if we just have a plan because we have to work in that plan to get that goal done, we accomplish a lot things more when we are doing something, when we have that determination to get things done to feel proud of ourselves.

First of all we have to feel, we need purpose and strength to accomplish every goal in our life to feel proud in a future. Then he became a mayor because people chooses him as their mayor because of all his honest job, he started running for president in 2015, he had a hard time trying to find a political party that supports him with his new ideas and purposes for the country but the parties rejected him because they said he was to young,also they knew he was honest and that he will not admit any corrupt job that affect the country, and they were always looking for reasons to reject him, but he did not give up.

Finally he made his own political party and he get the support of all the people that get tired of live in niggardliness during the governance of other parties, he fought against the two most powerful parties in our country, as a result he won the elections in 2019 and he became the new president of the nation.

Many people think that it doesn't matters if you have goals and make plans for your future if you don't have some resources as money or a good social status, they can also see life as a random game which means that if you accomplish something they will say that is just luck, however; what they call luck, other people call it, late nights of doing something for what you want for your life.

In other words if you want your life to be successful, you don't have to spend your time just dreaming about what you want, because things may be done only if you are always doing something which means; work for what you want, stop thinking about your life goals and start working on them, determine yourself never to be an idler.. My grandmother used to say ""Your goals are not going to be done if you don't even move a finger"".

I am totally agree with what Thomas Jefferson wrote about how wonderful is how much we might done if we are always doing something. Then in my head I said ""if I don't get that courage to make the journey I will never going to see my parents again"" because I knew that they can't go back to my country, at the end I made that decision and I made it, I am with my parents again and as a gift I learned a new language, now I know i'll be more helpful for this country because I am bilingual now.

Furthermore, we can see in every aspect of life how persons that one day were a common citizen, now are really important in the society because they were always doing something, they were working on their goals. He was just a citizen like others but he was tired, tired of the political corruption that my country was going through, so here is what he did; he made his plan, he worked on his plan, he worked and made things for the country. why? Because I was afraid of the journey to be with them again, they used to tell me ""If you don't do anything you will never know how different your life could be here with us, so throw that fear away and let's do something"". I had that dream, but yes, it was just a dream. On the other hand we have as example my home country, El Salvador's new president,Nayib Bukele",0
"But who am I to judge other people's opinion's. . And I mean a LONG break from it. And when you are tired you feel grumpy and disturbed by everything so it's better off just going to sleep rather than talking to family and friends because, all your going to bring is negative energy and no one wants that.

Final Reason is that summer break is basically like a reward for students that made it through the year. but what if they were to take that long summer break we once had and make it into a 3-4 week summer break! I would be beyond upset and I bet other students will too! Personally I don't think it's a good idea. So i'm going to just state some reasons why this not a good idea.

First Reason is that many students want a long break from school. But anyways back on topic. And for the educators that said we should get longer winter breaks and spring breaks it sounds like a good idea but it just doesn't make sense to me in my opinion.

Second Reason is that students spend more time with family and friends! The reason for this is that students don't have time to spend time with them because the're either doing school work or the're to tired to even talk so they go to sleep early because of how tired they are. The reason to this is because, we get stressed, tired, drowsy, and even suffer from all the studying and work we do year around. And this can cause depression in teens as well, and trust me I know that feeling it sucks. As we all know, students love summer break. A nice 3 months without work, stress free, relaxation, and do whatever you want and 3-4 weeks is not enough for us to be honest we need a good long break from it because we just need a little time to relax. In conclusion these were my statements on why summer break should stay as it is. And when September arrives it will be a fresh start and are minds will be clear and ready again too do more work",0
"We choose who we want to become. Not because I want to go to college and become a nurse, means that my best friend, that I spend most of the time with, would want to be a nurse or be in a medical field as me. People have their own dreams and choose their own path.

We choose our own paths. At the end of the day we choose who we want to be.

We choose who we want to be. The British naturalist and politician John Lubbock once wrote, ""Your character will be what yourself choose to make it

In my opinion, we do choose who we want to be. For some people it is just fun and dont think about the consequences. Some people might think differently and say that we are influenced by the people we spend our time with. For siblings, I think it is different because they are being raised by the same people and have almost the same points of view, but that does not mean they are or think the same. We do choose who we are because not everyone thinks the same, we choose our destiny, and parents raise their children with different habits and knowledge.. Yes, we are influenced by the people we see everyday and we might just take it as inspiration, but we are the ones who work towards our goals and not anyone else. Not everyone thinks the same, and people are raised differently.

We were all raised differently. There could be two sisters being raised the same but one might have different habits or opinions than the other. I once got invited to a party where I knew there were going to be lots of teens drinking and doing drugs, so I told my friend, who invited me, that I didnt wanted to go because I new it was bad. I agree with John Lubbock because not everyone has the same intentions as the people who surround us, we choose our own path, and people are raised differently.

Not everyone has the same intentions as the people they hang out with",0

"There are people who stay indoors just listening to music, but you can actually go outside and do activities while listening to music. Riding your bike can actually help you later in life, because it can give you stronger bones and can improve your stamina and strength.

Another thing that you can do is play outdoor games, such as tag, freeze tag, and hide and go seek tag, but there is many more. Therefore i suggest that people, especially kids, to go outdoors more.. going outdoors is actually more fun than staying indoors doing nothing, because you can do a lot of activities. Also when your going outdoors make sure to bring someone with you so you can do activities with them. I think that some people find outdoor activities enjoyable, because they can do activities with others and enjoy the weather while doing activities.

People should go outdoors more, because if they dont go outdoors and dont do activities, there is a chance that later on in life they can have weak bones. If you dont like to play sports, exercise, or run laps you can just ride your bike. And if you have no one to do activities with head over to a local park to do activities with other people. I think that many people are avoiding going outside, because of cell phones. These outdoor games can also improve your stamina and strength. A good time to go outdoors is when its sunny and when you have nothing to do. Some activities you can do is play sports, practice sports, run laps, and do exercise. People these days dont go outdoors as much as they used to",0

Humans have tendency to procrastinate and be like

"" oh i'm going to do my homework and this or that tomorrow I have so much stuff to do""

but at the same time stay on there phone for hours. It can be very enjoyable to explore for example you can go to South Africa there are amazing food, animals if you go to the zoo its amazing, and fun to do with family or friends or even alone. For example your mom and dad work really hard to affords all the stuff you need and you and your brothers and sisters are barely able to see them. Going to the park with them , walking around, talking have a nice conversation without a rush, joking around are ways you can spend time with family. Some people cant even have a decent conversation with family or spend time outdoors with their brothers and sister because they are too busy on their phone for hours. On Saturdays and Sundays are the only time your able to see them and have quality time with them but you are to busy in your room chatting with friends a d doing your homework, but all you have to do is take a break and spend time with them. Parks, museums, and other places have good outdoors activities that helps humans stay away from technologies. Exploring can also be fun you can go out meet people you can go to book fairs, concert from your favorite bands or singers, try out different restaurant, try something crazy like jumping from a cliff and going into the river, swimming with sharks or dolphins, you can meet people who might be with you your whole entire life, have connections with them, visiting a museum, a aquarium.

Secondly, spending more time with the outside world is an amazing experiences because it allows you to discover all the amazing living creatures, food, cultures, countries , other ways other people live, etc. "" Why stay home bored out of your mind when there are enjoyable ways you can spend outdoors?

I think outdoors activities are more enjoyable then indoors activities because you can spend more time with family, spending more time exploring the world, and take time away from all those electronic devices. There are fun ways you can explore the world with all these outdoors activities.

"Secondary, some students become involved in activities, and allows students to not have so much time to finish their homework. Generic_Name is very athletic she join in the soccer team, and she stay after school for practice everyday during the week. If she doesn't stay these days, then probably she will have more time in the afternoon with her family. Plainly, the participation that she demonstrate in the sport she improve as athletic.

Some people say that involved in activities will impair some students because they can focus more in participating in activities, and not focus in their class grades. If she doesn't stay after school every day, then she probably will have more time to complete her homework. In addition, some students involved in activities that they don't have so much time to study or complete assignments. Not only the extracurricular activities enrich the education, being involved in activities allows a student to have little time to do homework assignments as well.

Additionally, some students become involved in activities like sports and they have little time to do their homework or study. Conversely, a lot of students participate in extracurricular activities, they have less time to study, and they have little time with their families. Finally, students who participated in activities after school they have less time with their families in the evening. However, this idea is inaccurate. She likes to participate in the class activities, games, and clubs. For example, Generic_Name is a student with a great purpose in life, and he wants to study a career. However, many students likes to participate in activities of the school. Many students become participated in extracurricular activities to acquire a great educational experience. In particular, Generic_Name is a student who likes to participate in the activities of the school. If he didn't participate in the club, then likely he will no receive help from the club. He become involved in activities like staying after school while he was in high school because he wanted to improved in the school, and be a good student. As a result, he thinks that maybe is not necessary being involve in so many activities to enrich a educational experience. She is a smart student, and she likes to get good grades as well. When she stay those days she pass little time with her family. A student who join in activities don't have so much time to finish their homework. Most importantly, a student who wanted to overcome in life wanted a good education. She just stay after school on Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays. When he don't understand his homework assignments he go to the club. She thinks that it can possible to her because she shows interest in what she wants. Finally, the students who participate in activities after school they don't spend so much time with their families in the afternoon. Many of students prefer to participated in extracurricular activities to improve their educational experience. With a good behavior and good grades he will enrich in his educational experience. If he show good grades in class, then probably he will be better in his education. Case in point, Generic_Name is a student she goes to high school, and she likes to play soccer. Furthermore, when she get involved in the soccer team now she don't have so much time to complete homework assignments, and study. Participate in activities allows to have little time to complete assignments, and allows to spend little time with the family as well.

Lastly, students who get involved in activities after school they obtain little time with their families. She likes to stay after school because she is participating in one club. . For illustration, Generic_Name is a student and he participates in a club where he obtain help with his homework, and projects. Therefore, participating in other activities the students can obtain help with their homework, projects, and improve their grades.

In conclusion, participate in activities can be helpful to some students. Some people argue that if students participate in activities they will focus more in what they participate; however this is the opposite because they can obtain help with their homework, and projects. Undoubtedly, sutudents involved in the activities of the school.

"If you have ever done something wrong, you might want to ""think before you act."" If you were to do something without knowing the consequences, you're going to get in trouble. Even though knowledge is really important to learn, it may go away or you might not need it in the future career or job you wish to do.

Life is full of bad people. Since you already did them you're have a good visual of what you might expect to happen to you in the future if you did something wrong without thinking about it. Example, if you wanted to prank a teacher on the last day of school or hitting a school clock, causing it to fall and break, you might want to think before you act.

You might also want to ""imagine"" what would happen to you in the future if you did something wrong. Imagination is better than knowledge because its there with you forever. Knowledge is taught to you, but what is taught to you, you might forget it in the future. In my opinion, i think what Albert Einstein is saying, might be true. He was the creator of the space and time theories that in my opinion, I like very much.

Albert Einstein had to use imagination and knowledge at the same time in order to come up with those theories. you might also want to have knowledge because if you thought of the consequences and or imagined them, you wouldnt of done it in the first place.. I agree with Albert Einstein's quote,""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" I agree with this quote because, knowledge is building up in your mind little by little because people are teaching it to you.

Even though knowledge is going to be extremely helpful in the career you desire to have, you must have imagination in order to ""look"" into the future and see yourself doing something good with your life. Imagination is what you want it to be, nobody can control it because it's yours to keep and think about in your mind. He also needed knowledge in order to know what was out there in deep space and to know the truth behind black holes and all that cool\space stuff. Einstein was one of the smartest human beings on earth known to man kind. Another good reason is to learn from your mistakes. Also things that you learn in life might not be used in the future or in the career you fore seek to be doing. I think imagination is like a little world in your mind that only you can control. Imagination is a real thing. What if bad people that are in jail right now, would've thought of the consequences before committing the crime? Yea, they probably wouldnt of done it",0

When students come back from break regardless of the season they most likely cannot retain information, because they have been gone for a long period of time. Teachers should assign online classes and review's for students to help memorize information at least once a week. Changing the season of the break would not be enjoyable either cause of cold weather, it would certainly not help students to remember the information they learned when they were in school. Making winter break longer than summer and a week off in spring and fall is not a good idea. Even though students cannot retain information on learning targets, at least it wont waste time because having a longer winter than summer would extend time causing time to be lost in the school year. Why should educators feel that a longer winter break than summer could help retain information?

In my point of view having a longer winter break would not be enjoyable students like the fact that they can be able to enjoy their break. That way when people return to school others wont be so behind on things and can remember the objectives taught. To begin with many students enjoy summer than winter. Whats a break if you cannot enjoy it?

In addition what maybe the students can take into consideration is to review some of the things learned, during the free time on their break. Having a longer winter break than summer is a waste of time. Overall there should not be a longer winter break than summer. A longer winter break could possibly help the scholar remember what was learned, if they were to revise and analyze work that was given to in the past in this situation.

In conclusion changing the season would not help students retain information and is not a good idea , unless the individual were to spend time studying a few times out of the break",0
"Think about it kids not doing well in homework and test for not studying for not have any time after school for the extra hour and thirty minutes they are going to get that wont be good for the school county and less students would start coming to there schools and rather transfer to a better school with less hours or just consider home school and your school would have kids leaving and wont be able to have students to teach anymore. While other parents my think if there going to add more time to school then students should arrive to school at least 20 minutes later for kids to have more time to sleep for an long school day, so they wouldnt be sleepy in the mornings. As may I think that over the week ends families like to go to far places and if students end up having projects and home work to do could effect the time with family and school and that wouldnt be so good for the students. Education are good for the kids but getting low grades may not help them in the future and for the family. Many students wont have anytime to be spending with their family together any more with those times being spent on school and sports and other activities.

Families may think its a bad idea too add more hours to school and to take away time after school to get things done and to have time to enjoy with families at outside places at an restaurant or to go out for walks before bed times and the next day. Witches end up shutting your schools programs and closing the school and there wouldnt be any jobs for teachers or you to find quickly enough to pay bills and rent witch wouldnt be so good for the employees.. Many students go to after school activities at certain times and get out later others dont but do some outside of school activities like sports, helping the community, getting chores done, {etc.}. I understand why you want to add an hour and thirty minutes to school for kids to get more time to learn.

But think about the children may think its a bad idea and I agree with them as well. Why? you may ask, well lets think about it kids dont want to be at school for a very much more time in what they are already in for. You may seem like those arent important but for the students do think its important and also school, but the home work time they have left to do at home my not be a good idea on the different after school programs they may be in at different times when it starts and when it end times go fast and may not be time to go over homework or study for a test the next day",0
"All you have to do for online school or video conferencing is get online and do all your classes, and not worry about getting to school. Students need to go to school instead of online or video conferences to learn more and participate in class or school.

Going to school than taking online classes or video conference is way better because you go to school and actually pay attention and not get distracted of what is around you in school ,however, taking online classes can get you easily distracted when you're at home or a public place trying to do you work and you hear people talking and having conversations all around you. Even though, everyone would prefer online classes over actually going to school, people should consider going to school for a backup just in case the people taking online classes don't like how it is done. Students have to attend school to learn more efficiently, but long distance learning is not good because you have to take your own notes online ,however, if you were to attend school on regular time, you would not have to worry about taking your own notes. Students need to go to school instead of online or video conferences to learn more and participate in class or school.. Also students can have more time to work and can be actively speaking with our teachers too, for questinos and answers to help students. Although, online is still a option because you just need a computer or a laptop to take online classes, and not having to worry about missing the class when the teacher took notes that day. While you're in school you can peacefully finish all your work in class and ask for a question, or even help from the teacher, but if you're taking online classes your only source is most likely going to be a online source, or the guides they give you online which might not be always correct. Going to school and learning just for being in class helps you in a lot of ways such as visually, speaking, and self control, however, if you're at home taking online classes it will only help on your visual learning.

Taking online classes can probably be difficult sometimes, because people can forget to take the class the day you need to log in ,however, going to school and knowing which days to go to school is very helpful because you can learn without any problems happening. while the information at school is planned out and ready to be given out by the teacher or staff at school. This is why going to school is more efficient. The information online could be outdated. Although taking classes online and not having to go anywhere and stay where you are is good, you're putting your grades at risk, the computer can malfunction or even be corrupted with a virus on it, and it can slow down your computer or even shut it off every time you need to do your work. The people that go to school have no worries just bring all the materials they need for class and work and pay attention",0
"Automobles have been around for a very long time now i guess if my calculations are right its been almost 1,500 years since Henrey Ford showed the world his first ever automoble, the Model T. Another reason why i say that is because without losing those battles and wars how wouldve we found out about atomic bombs or harden steel bullets. He had to go through so much walls blocking his path in order to show the world that a automoble was and still is possible. Another example would be Tesla. It sounds crazy and highly dishorroable to are fallen heros who were killed in action, but if we won wars and battles everytime we would soon fall. But in the spring of 1830 he successfully got one fully working and running. So if failure wasnt an option for these two companys the cars of 2020 wouldve sucked so much because the company will only car about the money and just send running crappy looking cars that we humans have as a need for work and family.

Those are my last two thoughts about failure and Wisten Churchill isn't wrong at all. The famous electronic car company to power there cars with electricity. And we wouldnt live the world we live in today if it wasnt for people back then who didnt stop failing until they reached succesed.. those guys mustve gone through so many experments that i cant even imagine and the amout of failed ones too and im pretty sure there is alot more failed test projects than passed ones. I do agree with Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchhill without failure how can we humans excied in life to get to success? To prove my statement i will provide two reasons, and also two examples, explaining why i believe that failure can lead humans to a world we couldnt imagine it could exiest.

Reason number one would be Battles and Wars. I believe that losing Battles and Wars help us the united states of america create new weapons wither it was nuclear or bullets. Henrey Ford had to go through so many people doubting his Model T project would work. I say that to be reasonable about it not saying it to make fun of them because if they didnt fail the first time the first modles would have been super crappy, like the cars would suck. Because we keep using the same positions and plans in order to win, and we also would feel too confident in wining so we will be using the same weapons over and over again and let the other team discover those new atomic weapons.

Reason number two is about automobles. Without failure succces would feel like nothing like if it was pointless. Because after every failed project you get new ideas and new imagines of how you want the car to repersent the company and have a good repuation. Day by day, month by month, even year after years of failed experments",0

Ultimately, the decision as to whether students should work in schools or their homes depends on many factors and must be made on an individual basis. 

When students work in a school setting, they benefit from frequent social interactions and the varied perspectives of their classmates. This can be particularly beneficial for students who are more independent and self-motivated and need less guidance. Social interactions, academic improvement, and peer support are the main choices that need to be weighed in this decision. They can utilize their differences to collaborate closely on projects, which can in turn lead to better academic performance. Students are able to work in a comfortable and distraction-free environment. 
When considering whether students should work in schools or their homes, many factors must be taken into consideration. At the same time, students can maintain contact with their peers and teachers online through video conferencing to ensure they do not miss out on the social connections while also avoiding potential problems of in-person interaction. 

However, working from home has its own set of benefits. Both options offer advantages, and it is important to assess a student's particular needs and their preferences before making a decision.. At the same time, they can build relationships with peers and have support from each other in a positive and safe environment",1
"For physical activity, going to the park can be a great way to get some exercise and fun in, with lots of activities such as playing sports, biking or scootering, walking, running, and more, so it’s perfect for any group or individual. Participating in outdoor activities with friends and family can have many benefits such as improving physical and mental health, and can be more enjoyable than just going to the gym. With the lovely sunshine and fresh air, you can take in the beauty of nature and make the most of the outdoors. This kind of exercise can be great for physical health, but the mental benefits should not be underestimated. 
Going outside can be a great way to get some exercise and relax your mind. Connecting with nature and participating in real world activities can help to reduce stress, and can be especially beneficial for those who have experienced mental wellbeing issues. Overall, it’s clear that getting outside and enjoying the world around us, even if it’s just for a little while, can be a great way to improve physical and mental health.",1
"This increase in self-confidence pushes them to persist in their efforts to reach the goals they have set for themselves. Furthermore, reaching a goal gives an individual a sense of accomplishment and self-praise that can last long after the goal has been achieved.

Recent studies have shown that when people make progress towards a goal, their self-esteem increases. Accomplishment of a goal not only provides an individual with long-lasting satisfaction but also pushes them to continue striving for greatness. 
Reaching goals helps to build an individual's self-esteem in many ways. When students improve their grades, their self-concept tends to improve as well.

Overall, the evidence confirms that achieving goals helps enhance an individual's self-esteem in multiple ways. Accomplishing a goal gives an individual a renewed sense of self-confidence and a feeling of self-efficacy they can use to tackle the next goal. Additionally, students who make progress in their academic endeavors often report higher levels of self-esteem. For instance, athletes demonstrate improved self-concept after successfully completing a challenging physical task, such as running a race or performing a difficult routine in a gymnastics event. With little effort, these positive behaviors can help individuals feel more empowered and confident in their endeavors.",1

    One of the greatest examples of success against the odds is Wilma Rudolph, a champion Olympian who overcame childhood polio to become one of the greatest sprinters in history. Even when presented with failure, Wilma saw it as a learning experience and she was motivated to strive for the success she deserved. 

Rather than aiming low and potentially missing out on success, it is better to aim higher and work hard to make one’s dreams come true. Ultimately, it is better to aim high and strive for success, as it can be used as a learning experience and motivator to reach for one’s goals.. Along with her own hard work, she was driven by her determination and a determination to reach her own potential. With hard work, dedication and the will to strive for success, great things can be achieved, no matter the odds. Despite hardships, she pursued her goal of athletic greatness and achieved it, against all odds. Achieving partially is better than not achieving at all, and the possibility of not reaching a goal is far less than the possibility of success",1

One potential benefit of a 3-year high school program is that it allows students to complete their high school education at a faster pace. Additionally, the courses offered through a 3-year program are typically more rigorous, so students that graduate from these programs are more prepared for college or post-secondary institutions. This would allow students to finish their education by the age of 18, instead of having to wait until they are 21 or 22 years old. 

On the other hand, there can be drawbacks to enrolling in a 3-year accelerated program. For example, some students may find it too challenging to keep up with the workload or may find their social life suffering due to the added hours spent studying. However, these programs may not be suitable for students who may struggle with the extra pressure or need the extra time to develop both academically and socially.. 

In my opinion, 3-year high school programs can be beneficial for certain students, particularly those who are highly motivated and are confident they can handle the increased workload. Additionally, due to the accelerated nature of the program, the dropout rate may be higher than for traditional 4-year programs",1
"
Distance learning can be an incredibly beneficial tool for students in a variety of situations. Similarly, distance learning can provide comfort and flexibility for those who want to learn independently or take their time to reflect on the material at hand. 

Ultimately, distance learning is best suited for students who value autonomy, organization, and independent thinking. Additionally, the distance between student and teacher can impede the quality of the class, providing less of an interactive learning experience than being physically present. For some, the lack of motivation or focus can be a significant hindrance to learning. 

That being said, distance learning is not without its drawbacks. 

For those with busier schedules, distance learning can be a great way to work through schooling without sacrificing work or other commitments. It’s important to be honest about the inherent limitations of distance learning, however, and to recognize what type of learner will be the best suited for this type of environment.. Those who want to stay on top of their coursework without having to attend physical classes are ideal candidates. It offers the unprecedented convenience of being able to access classes and complete coursework from the comfort of your own home, providing the autonomy to structure learning around existing commitments and lifestyle",1
"I believe that partnering with the next generation to foster knowledge sharing and collaboration would be useful for both sides. Growing up, I was exposed to a number of medical professionals in my community who inspired me to pursue medicine as a career. It would help me to learn more about the ever-evolving medical field and new technologies, while at the same time invest in the future of healthcare by educating the next generation. I cherish the knowledge I have learned and am driven to pass it onto the next generation. 
 My interest in the medical field began at an early age. By providing mentorship, I hope to not only facilitate the learning of the new generation of medical professionals but also inspire others to pursue their dreams and ambitions.",1

Although learning from home may limit future college prospects, for some students it may actually expand them. For those easily distracted by the presence of others, home learning can be less stressful. 
Attending school and learning from home have both their benefits and disadvantages for students studying history and other required school subjects. In addition, attending physical classes requires more preparedness, as well as having to wear a mask and adhere to other protocols depending on the area. On the other hand, taking classes from home may have effects on college prospects, as remote learning does not offer students physical mentorship and networking opportunities. By taking classes remotely, a student might gain the opportunity to hold a job, whereas if they were in a physical classroom, they might be too restricted.

When considering the student view, learning from home can have a greater impact on mental health. It's important to consider not only the academic prospects, but also factors such as ease of learning and how their mental health and comfort may be affected in each situation.. Real-world examples such as the ability to live in a college and work while attending do exist, and this approach can be beneficial for a student trying to balance multiple responsibilities or who prefers a flexible learning schedule. Furthermore, with the guidance of multiple teachers, students can more easily get a better understanding of the material or ask questions. However, attending school is also important for developing study habits and discipline.

When looking at both the pros and cons, the approach which is more beneficial for learning history and other required school subjects might ultimately depend on the students themselves and the situation. In terms of GPA, attending school provides students with more access to in-person resources such as tutoring and other forms of academic help from teachers or fellow students",1
"This can be crucial when it comes to embarrassing situations that can happen in social settings. 
As humans, we are constantly evaluating, learning, and growing through our experiences. Taking lessons from the past situations and feeling comfortable enough to properly apply them can be the difference between being more confident and successful in our first impressions, or perpetuating embarrassing, and sometimes embarrassing, situations. Every individual has their own set of experiences that shape them, and therefore, the ability to better prepare for these situations will depend on acknowledging our past experiences and using them to form our future actions. The goal then to is to learn from past experiences in order to gain the necessary skills to successfully stand up to and prepare for potential embarrassing situations.. It can be said that our past experiences shape our future first impressions, either through how we prepare ourselves or how we interpret the reactions and feelings of those around us",1
"From Elon Musk to Oprah Winfrey, there are countless stories of individuals who have failed on their paths to becoming global success stories. Prominent successful individuals serve as examples of how mistakes can lead to great accomplishments. 

First, by looking at the lives of prominent successful individuals, we can see the role of failure in their success. 

We can also look at the relationship between failure and success in our own lives. In particular, while preparing for my college entrance exams, I was faced with many challenges and failed the first few tests. His famous quote, “sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick,” serves as a reminder that failure is a necessary challenge to encounter when striving for greater success. 

In conclusion, it is clear that failure can be a powerful stepping stone to success. This is evidenced by the countless prominent successful individuals who have experienced numerous struggles on their path to success. And not just small setbacks – individuals like Thomas Edison, for example, demonstrated the huge leaps of progress that can made from grappling with mistakes, which ultimately became the foundation for some of his most impressive accomplishments. By exploring specific real-world examples of prominent successful individuals, exploring the relationship between failure and success, and looking at my own life experiences, I will demonstrate that experiencing failure can be an essential step towards success. 

This essay aims to address how failure can ultimately be a key element to achieving success. Furthermore, by reflecting on our own life experiences, we can understand the significance of failure in helping us grow and reach our goals. 
No matter how hard we work or how much ambition and motivation we have, failure is as much a part of success as accomplishments. I, for one, have experienced numerous failures while working towards a goal. It was not until I looked at the mistakes I made that I could understand what I was doing wrong and make necessary changes in my studying approach. For example, Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs was famously fired from the company he helped build, only to return and lead it to even greater success. As such, it is crucial to embrace failure in any endeavor in order to reach true success.",1
"It is therefore essential to understand and have faith in yourself, and believe that you can achieve anything you put your mind to. Furthermore, trying to live according to societal expectations can be exhausting and draining. No matter what society tells you, having faith in yourself and believing in the power of your dreams is essential if you want to succeed and reach your goals. You find yourself constantly at war with yourself, struggling to reconcile the person society wants you to be with the person you know you are.

At the end of the day, you are the only one who truly knows what is right for you. When you have the courage to trust in your own dreams, aspirations and goals, you open up a world of opportunities. Having trust in your own abilities and striving for what you believe in is essential for inner peace and real success.

The importance of trusting yourself is further highlighted when we consider what happens when we don't. 
Being true to yourself is perhaps one of the most important actions you can take in life. If you succumb to the pressure of following the standards set by society, you run the risk of changing yourself so drastically that you no longer recognize yourself. Believing in yourself can open the door to a life of real success and inner peace.. When this happens, it can be difficult to find your way back to the person you were meant to be",1
"Obtaining a driver’s license, finding a job, or getting into a good college may be more difficult if a student does not have the skills or maturity of a traditional four-year student. 

However, graduating high school early is not without its drawbacks. By taking summer school, evening classes, or fewer elective courses, students may be able to cut down their time spent in school and get an early start on the future. In summary, if students are well-equipped to handle the all-encompassing demands of finishing high school in three years, it can be a great opportunity to reach their paths to success earlier and put them at an advantage for their post-high school journey.. 

Completing high school in three years is an increasingly popular option for some students, as it allows them to finish school before the traditional four-year plan and move on to college or other activities at a younger age. The inability to complete elective courses or take advantage of more engaging topics may also hinder a student’s chances at success after high school.

Overall, I believe that graduating high school in three years should be considered on a case-by-case basis, as it is ultimately up to the student to decide if they are mature, disciplined, and academically-prepared enough to pursue such an aggressive course of study",1
"While it may provide teachers with greater leisure time, it is important to weigh the implications and maintain the respect and integrity due to the education system.. Teachers dedicate a great deal of time to their work and, by painting it as something that can be accomplished in a short amount of time, we risk giving the impression that it is a less worthy profession worth less than those requiring more working hours.

For these reasons, reducing work hours for school teachers is not a wise decision. This would detract from the crucial educational focuses of their role, and could lead to compromising standards as they would now be trying to manage more complex tasks in fewer work hours.

Lastly, reducing the amount of time teachers spend in the classroom could unintentionally devalue the profession as a whole. On the surface, it appears to be a reasonable notion; reducing the hours teachers spend in the classroom would limit their exposure to stress and provide more leisure time. It would also add additional strain on teachers, who would be responsible for teaching more material to a larger class in reduced time frames.

In addition, fewer teacher work hours could lead to the primary instructors being asked to take on additional roles in the school, such as extracurricular activities and guidance support. This would lead to an overall decrease in the quality of education provided, as it becomes increasingly difficult for a teacher to manage a larger number of students. However, this decision carries many far-reaching implications that ultimately make such a move inadvisable.

First and foremost, reducing teacher work hours would likely result in an increase in class sizes. 
The debate over reducing work hours for school teachers is one that has caused much contention in recent years",1
"Ultimately, it is up to us to choose these traits and create a unique life full of potential.

In conclusion, it bears repeating that the power to choose our own character traits lies within us. This could mean never settling for mediocrity and striving to reach our goals and push our boundaries, or it could mean never giving up on our beliefs and maintaining our sense of integrity. It could also mean being kind and compassionate, lending an ear to those who need it and a hand to those who are struggling. With the ever-shifting nature of the world, it is vital to be able to pick what elements of our personality are ours and which ones we should discard for the betterment of ourselves and those around us. But if we step back and take our lives into our own hands, we can decide exactly who we want to be. It is all too easy to be pulled into trends and succumb to societal pressures that shape our character. We have the power to shape our lives and our character. The process never ends until we die. Despite what trends, society, or anyone else may try to impose on us, it is up to us to choose our own character and live with the consequences of our actions.. The Victorian biologist, John Lubbock, sums up this idea beautifully when he said, ""In the long run, we shape our lives, and we shape ourselves. 
As individuals, we are all faced with the destiny of having to choose our own character traits. And the choices we make are ultimately our own responsibility.""

This sentiment is strengthened when we look at our own personal experiences. We have the power in ourselves to pick and choose the traits that will create a strong and positive person. With this power, we can choose to become the best version of ourselves, a bettering of our previous self and a new take on our own reality",1
"Taking breaks is essential for our physical and mental health, as it can help reduce stress, clear our minds, and foster creative thinking. It is equally as important to recognize the potential pitfalls of being inactive - without breaks, people are more at risk for fatigue, burnout, and decreased productivity.

When it comes to working hard or taking a break, there is no universal answer. While it is possible to accomplish more if you are working all the time, it can also be beneficial to take breaks in order to rejuvenate and recharge. Inactivity has the potential to serve a purpose - it can help restore energy levels, improve focus, and increase productivity. 
In Thomas Jefferson's famous quote, he suggests that ""much may be done if we are always on it nonstop."" While the sentiment of hard work can be motivating, it's important to consider the purpose of inactivity and its benefits. Ultimately, inactivity serves as a reminder that rest and relaxation are just as essential as hard work for achieving success.. Each person must examine the best approach for their specific situation",1

The use of mobile phones in classrooms for educational purposes is a topic that has received much attention in recent years. Furthermore, having confidential student information accessible on phones can reduce student-teacher trust and engagement in the learning process. This can lead to decreased grades, poor test performance, and a decrease in student-teacher interaction. Mobile phones can be a source of distraction, impede the ability to engage in academic tasks, and diminish respect from student to teacher. Research has shown that the mere presence of mobile phones in the classroom can create an atmosphere of distraction, and divert attention away from course material. On the one hand, proponents of the use of phones in educational settings believe that they can help facilitate learning. While phones can be used in educational settings to create collaboration opportunities, it is important to provide students with guidelines and regulations about the use of phones in the classroom in order to ensure that phones do not become a hindrance to student learning.. For instance, mobile phones can help teachers easily manage class assignments, store student grades, and create collaborative learning opportunities. 

Some major arguments against having students use their phones in the classroom are that mobile phones can significantly reduce the amount of time spent on academic tasks, impede students’ ability to engage with course material, and reduce students’ respect for their instructors. 

In conclusion, allowing phones in the classroom can have a negative impact on student learning. On the other hand, opponents of phones in classrooms contend that they can negatively affect student learning by becoming a distraction and monitor students’ academic performance",1

Choosing a career at a young age can be a difficult and impactful decision. It's important to consider the practicalities of the job, such as the level of education required and potential earnings. Making a commitment to a particular profession can open exciting doors and opportunities, but it can also lead to feelings of obligation and higher stress levels. It's important to maintain a sense of independence and autonomy while still making sound decisions for the future.. It's also worth taking into account the potential emotional and financial effects of such a commitment on both the student and their family. Of course, students need to explore all of their options and understand the pros and cons of committing to a particular career. For high school students looking to start down a career path, course selection should be based on what will ultimately lead to success in a chosen field",1
"Participating in sports or physical activity not only can improve physical fitness, but also mental wellness. Although there is a multitude of reasons why students should participate in extracurricular activities, three stand out: safety, health, and fun. Staying physically active is beneficial for the mind, releasing endorphins and reducing stress. 
Extracurricular activities form an important part of a student’s school experience. Being part of a sports team gives student a sense of camaraderie, while joining a club sparks a sense of belonging.  

To sum up, there are many reasons why students should participate in extracurricular activities. From keeping them out of trouble and promoting physical and mental health, to providing them an entertaining and fun experience, there are countless benefits to getting involved in school activities.. 

Extracurricular activities also help keep students healthy. 

Lastly, extracurricular activities are simply fun. Taking part in team sports, for instance, can give young people an outlet for their energy away from potentially dangerous and reckless behaviors. Joining clubs or volunteering also helps keep students out of trouble by giving them positive outlets for their time. Additionally, joining student clubs and conducting group activities helps students stay social and establish relationships with peers. 

Safety is a big reason why students should partake in extracurricular activities. These activities range from team sports, clubs, and volunteer opportunities, to art classes, singing, or involvement in school events. Participating in activities outside of the classroom is a great way to progress as an individual, make friends, and most of all, have a good time",1
"Additionally, I will look for ways to apply my talents in real-world scenarios, such as submitting stories and articles to publications or giving speeches and presentations at events. 
I recently took some time to look inward and reflect on my interests and skills. Going forward, I will read up on writing and public speaking, join online courses or forums, and network with people in the writing and speaking industries. I'm excited to explore my potential and further develop these two talents in the coming months.. To hone these talents, I plan to practice and develop my craft in various ways. After considering what I'm passionate about and what I excel at, I pinpointed two possible talents: creative writing and public speaking",1
"I'm constantly looking to push myself and get better, and I love the challenge. There is no feeling like it.. Since then, I've been working to improve my skill and I put a lot of effort into it. It requires passion, dedication and hard work. Soccer has also provided me with the chance to travel the world and meet new people. Being able to experience the different cultures has been incredible and I'm thankful for the opportunities it has presented.

At the end of the day, playing professional soccer is something I'm passionate about and something I love to do. 
Playing professional soccer has been something I've loved doing ever since I was a kid. The fact that I can compete at the highest level and be challenged every day keeps me motivated to do better and get better. To become a professional soccer player, you need to have the right mindset. 

I feel playing professional soccer gives me a great sense of accomplishment and pride",1
"As I practiced and explored these instruments, I began to participate in musical contests, concerts, and any other opportunity to showcase my talents. My hard work paid off when I became the leader of a school band, and we wrote and performed a song for an important event. Music has been a passion of mine ever since.. I was curious about different types of instrument, and soon began to learn the recorder, xylophone, percussion, and the violin. 
My love of music started when I joined the school choir in elementary school. I was proud to have contributed to something so meaningful",1
"For example, growing up I had a close friend who was very outgoing and adventurous. Similarly, if a person is raised in an environment where creativity is actively encouraged and supported, they are more likely to be inventive and curious throughout their life. Spending time with them often pushed me out of my comfort zone and encouraged me to take on new challenges. 

Overall, it is clear that one's character traits are often heavily influenced and formed by the people we communicate with and the environments in which we live. This would have not been the case had she not been exposed to the various forms of art and creativity in her childhood. 
One's character traits are often strongly influenced by the people we communicate with and the environment in which we live. At a young age her parents exposed her to various forms of creative expression and provided her with the necessary resources and tools to be creative. As a result, she grew up to be very artistic and proficient in multiple instruments. 

To illustrate this point, one of my relatives grew up in an environment where she was surrounded by art, music, and books. Through careful consideration and exploration of these external factors, a person can cultivate an abundance of positive traits and become their best possible self.. Over time I developed a strong sense of confidence and an inclination towards taking risks, traits that I would not have had access to without my friend's influence",1
"
Thomas Jefferson once said, “Do you want to know who you are? Don’t ask. Furthermore, when we help others we are not only doing a kind act but enriching our own lives and the lives of those around us. Being actively engaged in education has many benefits; not only does it improve our knowledge but it also teaches us valuable skills that can be used throughout our lives. Act! Action will delineate and define you.” This quote emphasizes the importance of being active and how through action we define ourselves. On the other hand, remaining idle and being unwilling to take charge of our lives can lead us away from our goals. Therefore, it is important that we take a stand for ourselves and for others in the world so that we can bring positive changes for generations to come.",1
"On the other, our assumptions may be limited or misguided, preventing us from making truly objective decisions. Alternatively, when we wait to form a more complete opinion, there is the danger of procrastinating and making decisions too late. 
Considering one's first impression when making decisions has its advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, we may be able to gain a quicker and informed understanding of a person or situation. Ultimately, one's approach will depend on the situation at hand and the desired outcome.. Still, this tactic gives us the opportunity to make informed decisions that take into account all information gathered over time",1
". Having multiple perspectives can be difficult to process all at once, and it might cause confusion and conflicting opinions. Having multiple viewpoints can help identify potential benefits and drawbacks that might otherwise be overlooked. It is important to weigh each person's advice carefully, or else it could create too much doubt or indecision when making a choice. For example, if making a career decision, receiving advice from a mentor in the profession, a current colleague, and a former classmate who once pursued the same option can provide a comprehensive assessment of the pros and cons of the potential option. 

On the other hand, there can be drawbacks to receiving and considering advice from too many different people. 
When making decisions, it can be useful to consider advice from multiple people in different situations, as it can help provide a broad perspective",1
"This can be seen in the way people think, dress, and act, opting for the safety of conformity and the group mindset in order to fit in. 
Our society today often tends to favor conformity over individuality due to certain social pressures that limit creative thinking and encourage sameness. People are often judged harshly for expressing their own thoughts or ideas that deviate from what is considered “normal”. As the essay mentions, “Conformity facilitates consensus and thus generates security and stability within a society” (Goodman, 2018). This mentality can also be found in the job market, where having unique skills or ideas are often not valued and may even be seen as a disadvantage. People prefer certainty and will often limit their independent thinking in order to blend in. In conclusion, in our society today, conformity is often favored over individuality.",1
"There are several advantages to working in a group. By properly harnessing the sense of motivation and diversity created in the group, students can more effectively reach their learning goals.. 

Despite these challenges, group work can still be beneficial for students. People in a group can draw on the skills and knowledge of multiple people to reach a solution or understanding. Additionally, it can be difficult to make everyone feel included and heard, especially when there are a diverse range of personalities in the group. 
Working in a group can be a great way for students to connect, communicate, and collaborate on school projects. Working in a group on school projects can help students gain a better understanding of the subject by providing multiple perspectives and opportunities for collaboration. Furthermore, the collective effort can boost motivation and help to ensure that projects are completed in a timely fashion. Additionally, strong group dynamics can help foster creativity and encourage diverse perspectives when discussing a problem.

However, working in a group also has several drawbacks. Group members may not have the same commitment level or work ethic, which can result in project delays, task imbalances, and conflict",1
"Gather the academic and skills requirements of each job you might be interested in, so as to be able to consider which option is the best for you. First, research available careers related to your interests, including websites to explore the potential options. With careful research and open communication, you can be sure to make an informed and beneficial decision.. Remember to reflect on the potential impact that choosing a career at a young age may have on academic performance and other obligations. 
As someone interested in exploring their career options, there are a number of steps to take. Speak with a trusted teacher or counselor about your choices and get advice about potential benefits and drawbacks of making a career choice at a young age",1
"Asking for an additional half hour of their day would be taxing, both mentally and physically. 
In my opinion, adding an extra half hour to the school day would not be beneficial for students. Cut into the already limited time our families have together, an extra half hour of school would be an unnecessary strain. The extra half hour would make it increasingly difficult to not only keep up in school but to also support their team both physically and mentally.

Furthermore, it would be a hassle to quickly squeeze in doctor’s appointments or any other obligations students may have after school. 

In conclusion, an extra half hour of school would not be beneficial for students, and I am opposed to the school board making this decision.. 

Moreover, an additional half hour would directly interfere with student-athletes’ schedules. This would affect students of all ages, from kindergarteners who need their parents attention to teenagers balancing work and school - making parenting and family time much more difficult. Firstly, it would be detrimental to our families. Between student life obligations and homework, students have already committed much of their time to education. Any extra time spent in the classroom would be time away from practices, conditioning, or participating in games. Having just thirty minutes extra wouldn’t be enough time to travel to appointments, so students would have to miss class or find a new doctor song slot.

Finally, it is worth noting that the school day is already long enough",1
"
One of the most significant benefits of participating in extracurricular activities is the growth and development of the skills and talents necessary for further success in life. Such activities can help students find new ways to channel their energy and develop talents or skills in a positive direction. For instance, by committing to structured extracurricular activities, students are less likely to engage in activities that could lead to trouble or harm. While extracurricular activities can be a source of development and enrichment, the associated time and effort require a certain level of commitment from students, meticulous planning, and sacrifices regarding leisure and sleep amongst others.. Additionally, engaging in extracurricular activities may provide invaluable socialization opportunities and help expand a student’s capacity to engage with others from diverse backgrounds.

Furthermore, participating in extracurricular activities can prove important to avoiding and getting out of trouble. Taking part in extracurriculars can also mitigate the risk of getting involved with unsafe peers or environments.

It's essential to review and consider the pros and cons of extracurricular activities before committing",1
"This additional time to learn allows for greater comprehension of class material and encourages further exploration and experimentation with concepts. In a classroom setting, students have the opportunity to ask questions in real-time and get feedback on their work from a trained professional. While it may offer some level of convenience, physical classes allow students to take advantage of having a physical teacher to ask questions of, immediate feedback on their work, and additional time and opportunity to learn. Conversely, taking classes from home does not provide the same level of opportunity for students to ask questions, get clarification, and receive immediate feedback on completed assignments. Online classes may offer a feeling of convenience, but without a physical teacher present, it's up to the student to ensure that they are completely focused on the task at hand. 
One of the main benefits of attending physical classes rather than taking classes from home is the lack of distractions available. Attending physical classes is ultimately the better choice for improving their learning ability.. This can hamper their learning by limiting their understanding of the material and preventing them from getting the most out of the class.

Finally, attending physical classes rather than taking classes from home also provides more time and opportunity to learn. 

Overall, taking classes from home can be detrimental to student learning. In a physical class, students are able to take advantage of lunch, recess, and after-school programs that may not otherwise be possible when they are learning from home. 

Having an actual teacher to ask questions of and receive feedback from is also a big part of the learning process. Without a teacher present to redirect their focus onto the task, it's easy for students to get sidetracked and miss important points. It can be difficult to stay concentrated in a comfortable home environment, particularly when distractions such as television, the internet, and social media are just a few clicks away",1
"
I have always been passionate and driven in striving to develop and build upon my talents and skills. 

In conclusion, I am continually striving to expand my skillset and use these talents to make a positive impact on the world. I have been able to do this through both spoken and written mediums, such as speeches and articles. Furthermore, I have become increasingly apt at conveying my ideas effectively to a broad range of audiences. I am cognizant of my strengths and weaknesses and use this knowledge to better understand my goals and how I can use them to reach them. In these classes, I have learned how to come up with creative ideas quickly, structure a plot, and use vivid language to capture the attention of my readers. Over the past several years, I have taken an interest in a multitude of different areas, looking to build upon my existing strengths, and expand my knowledge into new domains. In my everyday life, this allows me to approach tough problems in a systematic manner and develop meaningful solutions. In those courses, I have been able to develop a better understanding of syntax, logic, and algorithms, enabling me to solve complex problems quickly and accurately. This has been reflected in my writing, as I have started to take on larger and more complex projects, such as novels and short stories. My talents and skills have helped me to grow in many areas, and I look forward to continuing to do so.. For instance, I enjoy writing and have taken up creative writing classes to refine my craft. In addition to writing, I am also versed in computer programming, having taken multiple programming courses",1
"This would make it especially difficult for students who may struggle academically or those who are involved in competitive extracurriculars. Additionally, this could also impede the quality of a student’s academic performance, considering the shorter time to complete each class. Families may also be burdened by the additional costs, such as textbooks, tuition and transportation fees. Although this decision has the potential to shave a year off of a high school career, college acceptance is generally dependent on credits completed and the courses taken. While some may view this decision as simply saving a year of schooling, there are a variety of factors to consider, including workload, cost, and potential future opportunities. In addition, students who do not take the traditional four-year route may find it difficult to stand out among competitors who are more experienced in their fields. Both of the options have advantages and disadvantages which must be considered before a student makes the right decision that best suits their needs.. Graduating high school in three years would likely require students to take more courses in a shorter amount of time. Graduating in three years would likely require students to pay extra for the extra classes or accelerated courses. 

Second, the cost. 

Finally, the opportunities. 

In conclusion, graduating high school in three years instead of four is a decision that should not be taken lightly. 

First, the workload. It is fair to critique that choosing the three-year option may limit a student’s opportunities in the future. 
Graduating high school in three years instead of four can be a difficult decision to make for a student and their family",1
"Online classes also enable students to pursue their desired degree or certification without being physically present in a classroom. 
Online classes can be incredibly beneficial and can open up many opportunities to those who wish to pursue higher education. There may also be challenges that come with studying alone, as students must find motivation and stay organized to complete coursework. Additionally, students may not have to pay any extra fees for online courses, making the potential for savings great. 

On the other hand, there are some drawbacks that come with online classes as well. For example, some courses may be more difficult to grasp without the help of an instructor present in the classroom. On the plus side, they provide flexible scheduling, allowing students to study and attend classes at times that work best for their individual lifestyle. In addition, a lack of face-to-face interaction with peers can make it difficult to ask questions and discuss ideas freely.",1
"The experiences of being an immigrant can be both challenging and rewarding; I have encountered both opportunities and obstacles, but ultimately am grateful for the growth and progress. Everyday resources and services are welcome additions that often make it easier for citizens and immigrants to manage daily needs and activities. Overall, my experience living in Generic_City has been a positive one.. Despite these unique differences, visitors can often find similar recreational activities that bring together old and new cultures alike. 

The culture and society in Generic_City differ from those of United States in several ways; language barriers, economic developments, and school systems are all examples of distinguishing characteristics.

Similarly, in professional settings, staying motivated can be a deciding factor in career success. Whether it's pushing your limits to move ahead in an organization or staying motivated to complete a project, maintaining dedication and enthusiasm can be key to making progress. Whether it's reaching a dream job or saving for a purchase, using motivation to move consistently towards a goal can be key to lasting success.

When working in a group, it is important to find the right balance between collaboration and division of labor, in order to optimize the effectiveness and efficiency of the group. Finally, the development of friendships and shared experiences through working in a group setting can foster positive emotions and boost morale, which can create an overall positive learning experience. Additionally, working in groups can foster important social skills such as communication and teamwork, while reducing feelings of isolation and loneliness that can often occur when working alone. Additionally, finding solutions that work for everyone is vital to ensure that the group's objectives are met.

In conclusion, group work provides students with numerous benefits, such as increased academic performance, improved social skills, and strengthened friendships. 
Working in a group setting provides a multitude of advantages, particularly in the academic setting. Collaborating and sharing tasks with fellow students can often lead to higher academic success due to the division of labor and increased opportunities for problem-solving. While working in a group setting can have its unique challenges, the advantages of group work far outweigh its drawbacks.",1
"This shows that success is not always correlated to fame and fortune, but rather to how much effort someone can put in with enthusiasm.

Clearly, the examples provided here are only a few of many. For instance, Bill Gates devoted himself to his charitable work with immense enthusiasm and his organization has contributed immensely to the betterment of society. 
Enthusiasm has long been seen as an important factor in achieving success. After all, it's great to have a goal of succeeding, but it takes enthusiasm and passion to actually take the steps necessary to reach that success. To do so, they had to work with enthusiasm and dedication to build their products and bring them to the market. Their enthusiasm and hard work paid off, and now Apple and Microsoft are among the most successful and well-known companies in the world. Both companies started out with a team of individuals with a common goal: provide innovative and user-friendly technology to people around the world. It can help drive an individual or an organization to work towards their goal with dedication, until they finally obtain the success that they are aiming for.. When someone is fueled by their passion and inner drive, their enthusiasm usually translates into hard work and dedication. 

Successful entrepreneurs and philanthropists are also an example of how enthusiasm can lead to success. To drive this point home, let us look at some inspiring examples of how enthusiasm has helped people or organizations to achieve great success.

One example can be seen in the rise of tech giants like Apple or Microsoft. Nevertheless, it is clear that having enthusiasm and passion is a key ingredient for success",1
"It has the potential to expose us to revolutionary ideas that can lead to groundbreaking discoveries. It provides an expansive view of reality that can lead us to achieving greatness. It can create and shape one's perception of reality, while producing seemingly limitless possibilities for the future. Imagination allows us to think beyond the limits of our own knowledge, challenging us to explore unknown territories. Imagination is fluid, without bounds or rules. 

When comparing imagination to knowledge, imagination takes the lead. 

In conclusion, imagination is more important than knowledge for many reasons. This freedom shapes the world we live in, as well as the future generations. 
The power of imagination has been described as an invaluable tool for navigating the world. Creativity and innovation are paramount for collective growth, and these qualities could not be achieved without the freedom of imagination. Imagination can be the foundation for creativity and inspiration to solve problems, unleash progress, and fuel progress for generations to come.. Knowledge is important and necessary; it is a form of understanding and can be critical for learning. But knowledge can often be rigid and restrictive, adhering to traditional ideas with limited potential for growth or innovation. It gives us the power to explore the seemingly impossible, producing radical ideas and stimulating creative problem-solving.

It can be argued that imagination is essential for progress",1

For those with limited time or energy to be inactive, hiring a butler or other household assistant might be the way to go. Rest is essential for our bodies to recover from daily activities, and can help us stay ahead of our physical and mental health. These extra hands can also help get through daily errands, cleaning, and organizing, so that less valuable time is devoted to mundane activities.. 

In small doses, inactivity can be beneficial for productivity purposes. I took a few hours to watch some TV and relax before tackling a big project I had been avoiding. It turns out the break was just what I needed to refresh and recharge my mind, and I was able to complete the project with relative ease. They can free up more time to relax, or prioritize and complete tasks so that downtime can be taken with peace of mind. Hiring household assistants like a butler or maid can help to further free up time and energy, making more time to be inactive. 

I experienced the benefits of inactivity firsthand after a particularly long work day. 
Inactivity can be beneficial in more ways than one. For example, taking breaks throughout the day to relax and recharge can help us to focus better on tasks that require more energy. Taking a break from school or work and catching up on our favorite TV shows can be an excellent way to stimulate our minds and relax our bodies. Taking some time for self-care can reward us with more mental clarity and improved productivity",1
"Therefore, while it is true that living a life without the help and support of others is more difficult, it is not impossible. 
In his essay ""Self-Reliance"", Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""The great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude."" This statement captures the essence of the idea of being alone in the world – that is, one can be surrounded by people, yet remain independent and content despite the lack of connection with them.

Nevertheless, while Emerson's words might suggest that it is possible to do something meaningful without the help and support of others, this idea is unrealistic in practice. One could argue that learning to rely on oneself could be a meaningful achievement in its own right. In fact, there are many examples of individuals who have made significant contributions without any sort of supportive network. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to determine whether it is possible to do something meaningful without the help and support of others.. In this sense, going it alone is rarely a viable option, and as such, it is difficult to do something meaningful without the help and support of others.

At the same time, this does not mean that it is impossible to do something meaningful alone. Human beings rely on each other for countless things - whether it is emotional support, advice, or practical assistance in achieving something",1
"It is also important to give students enough time to consider different career options and make an ideal career choice. Committing to a career helps students prepare for their adult life by promoting a sense of purpose, identity and structure. Taking the time to research opportunities, rediscover personal talents and passions, and exploring potential paths can be of great benefit in the long run.. Setting specific goals within their chosen career and metrics to measure progress can help students stay focused on their chosen path. 
High school students face the important challenge of selecting and committing to a career at a young age. Schools can help students understand the importance of committing to a career by providing hands-on job activities and internships, as well as career guidance",1
"As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.” Remaining true to oneself, despite the obstacles thrown in our path, shows tremendous courage and resilience.

Throughout history, there have been countless examples of people who have defied societal expectation to remain true to themselves. 

It is not easy to stand up against the expectations of society, but by remaining true to oneself one can gain invaluable clarity, peace of mind, and strength. 
In today's fast-paced world, it often feels impossible to stay true to oneself amidst the conflict between personal identity and social expectations. People are driven to become someone else in order to fit in with society, and often find themselves sacrificing their true identity in the process.

This need to conform can have dangerous repercussions. Hiding one's true identity may cause one to become increasingly out of touch with their emotions and the things that truly matter to them. By choosing to embrace one's identity in spite of society's influences, one can remain true to oneself while still connecting with the surrounding world.. Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, and Mahatma Gandhi are just a few famous figures who have courageously held onto their identities despite enormous pressure to conform to the status quo. Pressure from the people around us can make it difficult to maintain our sense of self, especially if we feel like conforming to the expectations of the society is our only option",1

Although a C average may not seem like an impressive academic achievement, it does not necessarily reflect the potential of the student. 

As a result, a student with a C average should at least have extra help and should be allowed to partake in activities with the agreement of the student, parents and teachers. Extra tutoring can also show the student new subject materials or help them bolster their understanding of a certain topic. 

With the agreement of the student, parents and teachers, these activities may include extra tutoring, field trips, and group projects. These activities can be an enlightening and empowering journey that can help the student reach their academic goals.. In fact, some students with a C average can achieve great success if given the opportunity. For these students, extra help and a chance to take part in activities can be especially beneficial. For example, a field trip can open new doors of knowledge, while a group project can help the student learn how to collaborate effectively. These types of activities can help these students learn the necessary skills they need to succeed in school",1
"Having confidence in our own decisions can be challenging but is essential in order to move forward. Learning to ask for advice or help can be invaluable when making decisions. By speaking to family members and friends, Obama's mother had the guidance needed to make the right decisions. 

These examples all demonstrate how critically important it is to ask for help and guidance when making important life decisions. Obama referenced this when he told a story about his mother's life, and how she leaned on her community for support when making important choices. In the episode, the protagonist struggles to choose between two career paths and ultimately relies on family members to provide guidance. 

I personally experienced the importance of asking for help when deciding between two job offers. I was uncertain which was best, but after speaking to an older colleague I found the confidence to trust my own judgement. It was comforting to have a knowledgeable person provide their perspective. Whether the advice comes from prior generations, family members, or other trusted confidants, having the support surrounding us helps us have the confidence to make the right choice.. 

In the political realm, President Obama discussed the importance of asking for help when making decisions. Additionally, an episode of the television show ""Black-ish"" explored the importance of family support and dialogue when making difficult decisions. 
Making important life decisions can be overwhelming. Prior generations can provide valuable insights and wisdom, while family members can both support and supply guidance",1
"

However, taking a three-year high school program can be quite challenging. This can be extremely advantageous for those who wish to move forward with their lives as quickly as possible. 
One of the primary advantages of taking a three-year high school program is that it allows students to finish their secondary education a year earlier. This can lead to a variety of benefits, such as getting started on college a year earlier, entering the workforce sooner, or taking a gap year and traveling. Students may find themselves needing to make more difficult or complex decisions in a shorter amount of time and struggle to keep up with the faster pace of the program. Additionally, some courses or extracurricular activities may not be available in the three-year format, which could be a major issue to those who are looking for specific activities or pursue a certain educational track.",1
"First, the act of offering thoughtfulness and care to someone can bring the giver satisfaction, knowing that they have contributed positively to someone else's life. When people ask for advice, it is often because they need help making a difficult decision or are seeking guidance on how to approach a particular situation. The rewards of giving advice are two-fold. This process of giving advice can be immensely beneficial to both parties. For the giver, they can gain a sense of fulfillment made from helping someone in need, and a greater understanding of their own experiences and feelings. For the receiver, they can gain insight and clarity about a situation, giving them guidance on the best course of action. They are looking for somebody to offer a perspective that they may not have considered or seen before. Ultimately, giving advice can be a powerful and deeply rewarding act for both parties.. Second, by sharing their story and advice, the giver can unlock hidden wisdom within themselves, as the act of revisiting their experiences and reflecting on them can lead to greater insight and personal growth. 
Advice is an invaluable tool for both the giver and the receiver. Furthermore, when the advice giver takes the time to really understand the advice recipient's situation, they can offer tailored advice that is tailor-made to help the person move forwards",1
"For example, students who lack social connections and access to sufficient resources may struggle with focusing and staying motivated. Ultimately, when deciding between distance learning and attending a public or private school, it's important to take into account not only the potential benefits, but also the potential disadvantages of each option.. 
Distance learning, or homeschooling, is an increasingly popular option for students of all ages. Although it offers many advantages such as flexibility and reduced stress levels, there are some key disadvantages to consider, such as a lack of social interaction and increased distractions. It's important to understand the potential effects of distance learning on a student's mental health and grades, as research has shown that these can be significantly impacted by their learning environment and resources",1
"

In conclusion, online classes offer a unique opportunity for students to learn at their own pace, from the safety of their own homes, and with the added convenience of making accommodations for medical or family needs as they happen.. Finally, for students with medical conditions, such as chronic pain due to autoimmune diseases, online classes provide a more comfortable way to learn, as they can be adjusted as needed for increased comfort and accessibility. For parents who travel frequently, for example, online classes give their children the opportunity to continue their education while on the road. 
Online classes provide many distinct advantages over traditional schooling, particularly for those with unique family circumstances, safety concerns, or medical conditions. In addition, online classes allow students to manage schoolwork in a safe and secure environment, away from potential threats that can occur in traditional classroom settings",1
"It’s about being honest with yourself and other people, and being genuine in all aspects of life. It can cause us to feel inauthentic and untrue to ourselves, creating confusion and doubts about our own determine life paths.

On the other hand, being ourselves allows us to be fully accepted and understood by the people in our lives. When we do this, we can start to establish long lasting meaningful connections and relationships with other people. We can also learn how to respect and value our own opinions and perspectives, instead of constantly worrying about what others think. We must embrace our authentic selves and take the courage to express them to others.. We can openly express who we really are, no matter how seemingly small. 

Ultimately, being true to yourself is essential to our wellbeing and to our relationships. When we pretend to be something we’re not, the consequences are serious and can cause lasting damage to our relationships with others and our own wellbeing. It helps to create authenticity, which is something that should not be taken lightly. 
Being true to yourself is one of the most important things you can do, both for yourself and for those around you. Being genuine comes from within and it can only be expressed externally when we are also true to ourselves",1
"However, failure is an inevitable consequence of life. 

On the positive side, failure can make someone a better person. 

At the end of the day, failure as a teen is unavoidable. As uncomfortable as a lesson in failure may be, it can create emotional maturity and humility. This self-reflection and insight can be invaluable in later life.

On the other hand, failure as a teen can have profound ramifications. It is important to remember that everyone has at least one failure in their life and the key is to know how to use this to one’s advantage. It forces teens to assess themselves, build self-awareness, and consider how to improve their skills or approach. Failing as a teen gives an individual the opportunity to identify their weaknesses and grow from it. Many teens take failure personally, letting it shape their self-confidence and their views of the world and their future. It can also lead to a feeling of being “stuck” or “broken” and thus unable to move forward. In some cases, a teen that experiences failure could find their hopes and aspirations dashed. With the right mindset and guidance, failure can be a fantastic teacher and provide opportunities to become a better person.. Despite the fear of failure that hinders many teens, failure itself has its pros and cons. It is during this time that youths can explore their passions and interests, without consequence. 
The teenage years are often seen as a time of exploration and testing limits. How one chooses to tackle the situation and learn from it will have powerful implications for the future",1
"Such knowledge can help people use kindness as a powerful tool for building bridges and achieve more harmonious communities.. On the flip side, a lack of kindness from acquaintances or family members can leave someone feeling lost and without a support system, which can have a permanent effect on their view of themselves and the world. 

Overall, an understanding of both the positive and negative effects that kindness can have on others is paramount to establishing meaningful connections and relationships. 

For example, a small act of kindness from a stranger can make a person feel appreciated and noticed, which can further impact their lives in a positive way. People who live without kindness tend to feel alone, anxious and like they don't belong, leaving them with a sense of unease and helplessness. Perhaps the most important benefit of all is that it can have a lasting positive impact on all involved. Kindness brings positive energy into any situation and helps to build strong, meaningful relationships with those around us. Consequently, lack of kindness can also lead to a lifetime of distrust and alienation from family and friends. It's important to understand that when we show kindness to others, we can also benefit from it as well.

On the other hand, neglecting to show kindness can have significant negative consequences. 
The power of kindness should not be underestimated – it has countless positive effects and advantages that people often overlook",1
"

In addition, from a student's perspective, distance learning has proven to be more flexible and cheaper. Students can develop their skills independently as well as set their own pace. 

In conclusion, distance learning has its benefits, but it's important to be aware of potential risks, especially for young people. It is also useful in situations where a student may have a disability or another condition that makes attending a physical school difficult.

For instance, a case study of a student in the US revealed the immense challenges they faced due to distance learning. Compared to a physical school, distance learning can present a range of social problems and may negatively affect a person's mental wellbeing if they find themselves too isolated or do not have adequate support. 
Distance learning has become an increasingly popular option for students across the world who find themselves unable to access a physical school. One of the main advantages of distance learning is that it offers educational opportunities beyond geographical boundaries and students of any age have access to extensive resources. While students may have access to many educational resources, nothing truly replaces the valuable experience of learning, growing, and connecting with peers in a physical school setting.. They faced distractions at home and struggled to maintain feelings of connection and motivation without the help of teachers or peers.

Despite its advantages, there are also potential risks associated with distance learning, particularly for young people",1
"By staying true to what her music was meant to represent, she ended up becoming one of the most successful musicians of all-time. It is often said that the phrase ""be yourself"" has become cliché, but in short, it is incredibly powerful. 
Everyone has unique passions, skills, and dreams, which can be difficult to pursue if you are not truly being yourself. In another example, the popular country music artist Taylor Swift found her success by writing honest songs that people could relate to. Through being true to your authentic self, oftentimes you can unlock the greatest accomplishments that you are capable of achieving. Both individuals followed their instinct and pursued what they were passionate about. 

From these examples, it is clear that the ability to be yourself can lead to great accomplishments. Their passion turned into ambition, which allowed them to eventually revolutionize how the world views technology today. 

For example, consider Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, two of the most famous entrepreneurs of all-time. These examples show that by understanding your truest passions and aspirations and believing in them wholeheartedly, you can discover your own greatest accomplishments.",1
"This type of self-imposed irresponsibility can have an immensely negative impact on their motivation and expectations for their learning. Some students may take advantage of the lack of structure present in these classes by skipping classes and engaging in activities that are non-academic in nature. Ultimately, distance learning classes have opened up new possibilities for students in terms of learning opportunities, as well as potential pitfalls in terms of difficulty in maintaining motivation and expectations for their own education.. On one hand, the lack of structure and supervision can allow students the freedom to take more responsibility for their own learning, but on the other hand, it can lead to neglect of their educational obligations. 
The development of distance learning classes has dramatically altered the way students approach their schooling. Distance learning classes have provided students with more opportunities to become self-directed and self-motivated, while creating new obstacles to overcome when it comes to taking responsibility for their own education",1
"They internalized their motivation to do better, working hard to acheive academic excellence. 

Grades, school, and homework are also crucial elements in the pursuit of success. 

This proves that attitude and commitment play a major role in success. When people see someone succeeding, it can spark the motivation they need to pursue their dreams and push their limits. Not only do these people have positive attitudes to drive them, but they have also learned to stay committed to their goals, no matter how difficult or lengthy the journey may be. Many successful people have had to overcome obstacles to reach their goals, and this has opened the way for demonstrating remarkable levels of self-motivation. Having a positive outlook can also inspire others to strive for their own goals. 
Self-motivation is an important component of success. Self-motivation is a trait that can have a significant impact on a person's success in life.. To understand how to achieve it, one first has to look at the stories of those who have already found success in life. Individuals who have reached success in their lives often attribute this success to having done well in school and having put in hard work and dedication to their studies",1
"Technology has both positive and negative effects on people's lives.

On the positive side, technology offers convenience and accessibility to people. We should be mindful of how much time we spend on our devices and remember to take time away from them to engage in meaningful activities.. It is nearly impossible to imagine how we functioned without the help of technology for so many tasks and duties. Additionally, technology helps us get access to a wealth of information that might otherwise be difficult to obtain.

On the other hand, there are some drawbacks associated with technology. Communication is also greatly enhanced because of the internet and all of the different ways we can now contact each other, such as emails, messaging apps, and social media. It makes daily tasks easier and can decrease the time it takes us to complete them. For example, it has been linked to an increase in mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Additionally, many of us spend a great deal of time on our devices, which leaves us with little time for other activities and relationships.

In conclusion, while technology brings many benefits to our lives, it is also important to be aware of the potential risks. 
Technology has become an integral part of our lives in the 21st century",1
"While it may initially seem daunting, the lessons and knowledge provided from failure should be looked at as an opportunity to grow. 

Overall, failure is not something most people desire, yet it can be a productive process. More importantly, failure can be one of the most powerful catalysts for success. It can instill a deeper level of motivation, leading to increased productivity and resilience. Failure can help sharpen our skills, belief in ourselves, and provide an authentic platform to persevere towards success.. 
When I look at failure, the first thing I think about is how much I have learned from personal experiences. It can be a pivot point where people decide to stand up, take action, and strive towards their goals with increased ambition and determination.

In conclusion, I believe that failure can have tremendous benefits for humans in the long run. By failing and coming to terms with the failure, I was able to develop a better understanding of how to work smarter and plan for things better in the future. Failure can also be seen as a learning experience and spark self-reflection, as it gives people an opportunity to reassess their current strategies and formulate a better plan or approach. One of the most influential experiences I have had with failure was when I missed a goal I had set for myself when I was younger. Although it was initially hard to grapple with, I eventually realized that the experience had helped me to grow as a person",1

"For example, when I was on my high school's soccer team, I was content to be a middle-of-the-pack player, when I had the potential to be one of the best players. 
As an artist, Michelangelo famously said: “The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.” This resonates with me, as I can think of multiple times in my life where I have set my goals too low and have forgotten to reach for the stars, as it were. On the soccer team, I pushed myself to excel on the field, eventually becoming team captain in my senior season. To quote the artist himself, “The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.” By seeking to challenge one’s self and remaining ambitious, a person can submit themselves to a path that may be difficult, but will ultimately lead to success in the long run.. In the professional world, I chose to take the time and actively explore new opportunities that have let me grow as an individual and be successful as a professional. Similarly, while looking for a job after college, I was all too happy to take the first offer that came my way, rather than researching other opportunities that could have made for a challenging, yet rewarding career.

As time passed and I set my goals higher, I began to see the positive repercussions of this decision. Both of these present a clear link between Michelangelo’s words and my own experiences. With any effort we put forth in life, we must challenge ourselves to set goals that will push our limits and boundaries, so that we can reach our maximum potential.

As seen in my own life, Michelangelo’s words serve as a reminder that setting our sights too low is a greater danger than failing to reach an ambitious goal",1
"On the other hand, distance learning offers students the flexibility to create their own schedule, the ability to complete coursework without having to leave home, and with the freedom to attend from anywhere. 

At a regular school, students are able to participate in a wide range of clubs, sports, and activities, such as band, theater, robotics, and more. 

A real-life example of how beneficial attending a regular school can be is that of Mary, a high school senior living in rural Michigan. Without the traditional structure of a regular school, none of these opportunities would have been available to Mary. 
Excerpt: 
In this essay, we will explore the pros and cons of attending a regular school versus distance learning. She was determined to make the most of her school experience and took full advantage of all of the resources her school had to offer. These encourage students to build social skills, develop their talents, and explore different interests. Through her classes, clubs, and activities, she was able to challenge herself academically, learn valuable information about college, meet new people, and develop her strengths and passions. Additionally, schools often have access to additional learning resources and materials, such as libraries, computers, tutoring programs, and specialized courses, that are not available to students enrolled in distance learning.. On one hand, attending a regular school allows students to be immersed in a traditional school environment where they can build relationships with peers, access valuable resources and get help from teachers",1
"
Distance learning has become an increasingly popular option for students as technology has improved and educators have embraced it. It offers several unique benefits compared to traditional classroom learning, such as greater flexibility, lower costs, and access to a larger variety of courses. Students can create their own study and work routines, and work at their own pace. 

Other students may find traditional classroom learning to be the better option. Face-to-face interaction with teachers and classmates can provide a sense of support and community that distance learning does not. 

For some students, distance learning can be a more attractive option because it provides greater autonomy. Traditional classrooms also typically have more course options and greater access to hands-on learning experiences such as field trips and extracurricular activities. 

Ultimately, the choice between distance learning and traditional classroom learning will depend on the individual student's needs and preferences. Each option has its own advantages and disadvantages, so researching the two and conducting a thorough comparison is the best way to ensure that a student chooses the best option for them.. They also have increased access to resources such as online discussion forums, chat rooms, and webinars",1
"In a regular school environment, students get the opportunity to learn social skills and work with classmates on group projects. By taking part in classroom discussions and physical activities, students can gain a better understanding of the material they are studying. Additionally, attending school in person can provide a sense of routine and can create a more rewarding educational experience. For starters, online courses offer convenience and flexibility. It is important to consider both options seriously and factor in each student's individual abilities and preferences. For students who may be struggling academically, online courses allow for a more individualized learning experience and can provide extra help when needed.

However, there are also some clear advantages to attending school in person. Some may find that taking courses online from home is a better fit, while others may prefer the traditional school experience.. Studying from home has numerous benefits that may make it better suited to certain individuals than attending school in person. 

In recent years, taking courses online from home has become increasingly popular for many students. Interacting with peers and teachers on a daily basis can be beneficial for developing important skills like collaboration, communication, and problem-solving. 

Ultimately, there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to deciding between online courses and in-person education. Those with physical impairments or other long-term health issues can participate in classes without having to worry about getting to and from school. Additionally, there is often more variety when it comes to what courses are available online",1

Extending the school day at Generic_School by two hours for four days a week has the potential to bring many advantages as well as some drawbacks. In my opinion, given the potential for improved student attendance, responsibility, and school culture, the pros outweigh the cons of implementing a longer school day.. An extra two hours of school would take time away from other personal pursuits and could limit the amount of time that students have for things such as sports, music, and community service. On the plus side, an added two hours could improve student attendance by providing a more structured schedule and giving students a purpose while outside of school. Increased responsibility could also be a result of extending the school day; with more time spent in the classroom, students would be better agitated to perform their best and follow the rules.

On the other hand, something that must be considered when making this decision is the trade-off between school and extracurricular activities. 

Ultimately, while extending the school day could bring about various positive changes, a careful evaluation of the potential benefits and risks should be conducted in order to determine if the extended day would be a viable option for Generic_School",1
"I have personally experienced the effects of this advice throughout my academic and professional career. With this kind of support, we can work to ensure that everyone has the ability to try something new and grow beyond their current limitations.. It is therefore essential that we examine the conditions of the disadvantaged and create equitable solutions to provide them with the same opportunities to reach their full potential. Given the daunting lack of resources available to many individuals, the idea of pushing beyond one's current boundaries can seem an insurmountable feat. On several occasions, I have boldly taken on projects that have initially seemed beyond my current abilities, and each time I have found that, with a bit of hard work and dedication, I can achieve not only success in the task at hand, but also gain even more meaningful insights in the process.

Unfortunately, not everyone has access to or takes the opportunities provided to them to explore and grow, particularly those in less-fortunate socioeconomic situations. 
Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement that “unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow” is a profound reminder of the importance of seeking new challenges and pushing oneself to continually grow as a person. Ways in which this can be done include increasing access to education and job training, as well as offering social and technical support to low-income individuals and families",1
"On the other hand, if not properly regulated, the use of cellphones can lead to distractions and can prevent better concentration on the lesson. 
The use of cellphones in classrooms can have both positive and negative effects on student performance. On the one hand, it can allow students to quickly access information and stay connected with their peers to facilitate group work. Additionally, the use of an educational app or online platform can help improve engagement in the classroom. Furthermore, the proliferation of smartphones can lead to issues of cyberbullying and phubbing, which can negatively impact student mood and attitude. 

In sum, while cellphones can be beneficial in terms of access to information and resources, it is important that clear rules and proper regulation are implemented in order to achieve an optimal learning environment.",1
"

It is important to consider the importance of trusting your own decision, rather than always relying on expert advice or the opinion of authorities. Other people, such as family and friends, can provide a valuable source of input, which can help give clarity to one's own ideas and provide insight into the perspectives of other people. Listening to professionals can provide helpful information, but one must always exercise their own judgment and be aware of their own feelings and thoughts. Ignoring your intuition and making the wrong decision can have dire consequences, ranging from missed opportunities to poor physical or mental health. This way, one can ensure that their decision is well informed and considered.. When making decisions, it is important to weigh up both one's own opinion against that of family and other sources, in order to make the best decision. Above all, it is essential to take one's time and thoroughly consider the decision twice before taking any action",1
"

On the other hand, there can be drawbacks to receiving and considering advice from too many different people. For example, if making a career decision, receiving advice from a mentor in the profession, a current colleague, and a former classmate who once pursued the same option can provide a comprehensive assessment of the pros and cons of the potential option. . It is important to weigh each person's advice carefully, or else it could create too much doubt or indecision when making a choice. Having multiple perspectives can be difficult to process all at once, and it might cause confusion and conflicting opinions. 
When making decisions, it can be useful to consider advice from multiple people in different situations, as it can help provide a broad perspective. Having multiple viewpoints can help identify potential benefits and drawbacks that might otherwise be overlooked",1
"In addition, in a student's academic journey, being idle will prevent them from achieving their educational goals, so it is important to stay focused and motivated. Ultimately, Jefferson's quote holds true - labor is essential and being idle will prove to be ineffective in practical scenarios.. This idea can be applied to various practical scenarios. For example, in the workplace, employees who are idle will not produce desirable results, so it is important that they stay engaged in their work. 
In his famous quote, Thomas Jefferson says that ""Labor is Prior to and Independent of Capital. Labor is the Superior of Capital, and deserves much the higher consideration."" Through this quote, Jefferson emphasizes the importance of hard work and communicates the idea that being idle is not a desirable quality. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed",1
"Without a balanced amount of outdoor time, people can be prone to lack of motivation and even depression. From physical exercise to mental health benefits, going outdoors can have a wide ranging positive impact. Listening to music outdoors can be a pleasant and rewarding experience. Overall, there are numerous reasons to go outdoors and reap the rewards of the experience.. 
Spending time outdoors has many advantages. However, it is important to take safety precautions such as wearing earplugs and avoiding loud noise. It is also important to be aware of the weather and any potential dangers, like slippery surfaces. Outdoor activities include sports, walking, and cycling to name a few. This may be due to people's saturation or over-dependence on indoor activities such as gaming. Outdoor games such as Touch football and Capture the Flag offer exciting opportunities for groups of people to go outside and enjoy while getting healthy exercise",1
"Having the support of family is also incredibly important when making decisions about the future. 
Making decisions about our future can have a significant impact on the rest of our lives. For example, Bill Gates decided to drop out of college and invest his time into starting one of the world’s most successful companies. We can look to many successful people who have made their own decisions and seen the positive impact they have had in their lives. Of course, patience is also vital to make sure that our dreams can be gradually achieved over time. Not only will it provide an individual with a sense of belonging and emotional security, it will also ensure they stay grounded and make rational decisions. Whilst this decision was brave and unorthodox, it was essential for him to reach his professional goals. In conclusion, making our own decisions and having the support of our family can help to ensure we reach our goals, whilst taking advice from others and exercising patience can also be beneficial.. Seeking advice from others is also beneficial; being open-minded and taking diverse perspectives on board can only be a positive thing",1
"Independent individuals have the freedom to make decisions which will directly affect the life they are leading, without any external pressure from other people or society. Here, the lack of independence meant that Mary felt pressured to make a decision which wasn’t right for her, consequently leading to her dropping out of school.

In conclusion, becoming independent by being yourself can have a positive impact on personal decisions, bringing about more confidence and allowing you to make better choices which reflect your own values and beliefs. In doing so, she was able to explore her talent for coding, as well as her passion, while feeling in control of her own future. Ultimately, the decision of whether to be independent or depend on someone else should be made mindfully, and not due to external pressures or expectations.. Likewise, depending on someone else can have both positive and negative repercussions. On the other hand, Mary was encouraged by her family to pursue a degree in Biology, but not for her own enjoyment or interests. On one hand, it can provide a strong support system of guidance and perspective, but on the other hand, it can create an environment of constraints and ‘shoulds’.

For example, Caitlyn decided to become independent by pursuing a career in web development. Being yourself is a way for people to think for themselves and make their own decisions, free from outside influences. However, depending on someone else can also provide guidance and support if used correctly. 
Being independent is a way for people to be unshackled from the expectations and opinions of other people and step out from the shadows of society. People who become independent by being themselves reflect their own authentic values and beliefs in their decisions, allowing them to become more confident and in control of their destiny.

The advantages of being true to yourself and remaining independent in this way can be seen in areas such as career decisions, financial decisions, and relationships",1
"A person can also develop new skills within an already familiar subject, such as furthering the understanding of mathematics. Many people take this statement as an invitation to push past their comfort zone and take a step into the unknown. 

Despite this, attempting something beyond what one has already mastered can be incredibly rewarding. Although this message may be motivating, there are a few who disagree with Emerson's viewpoint. 
Ralph Waldo Emerson is well known for his musing that ""a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds."" To him, it meant that life should be an ever-evolving journey of discovery rather than settling for what one already knows. Taking time to reflect on the lessons already learned can lead to personal growth that foundations have been laid for. 

It can be argued that people can still grow and develop without trying something new. By pushing beyond preconceived boundaries, people can open themselves up to fresh creative ideas and make incredible breakthroughs. Pushing boundaries and attempting something new can often lead to phenomenal results, both personally and professionally.. Finally, mastering something new may give a person the inspiration and confidence to attempt further feats.

Overall, Emerson's idea of venturing beyond one's comfort zone holds considerable merit. In addition to this, people may develop transferable skills that can be applied to a variety of contexts",1

"Many students rely on elective courses to gain knowledge in areas they are passionate about, so this can be a problem if there isn’t sufficient time. 
Completing high school in three instead of four years is certainly a tempting idea, as it shortens the amount of time that students spend in school if they wish to enter college or the professional workforce early. Therefore, students should weigh their options carefully and decide what is best for them.. Furthermore, those who enter the workforce at an earlier age may have more opportunities for professional development and career advancement, as they have a longer period of time to build their experiences and skills. While there are some potential advantages, such as taking advantage of college or career opportunities, there are also possible drawbacks, such as increased stress and lack of elective courses. However, there are some potential drawbacks to consider, including stress and a lack of elective classes. 

However, finishing high school early can also lead to stress. 

On the positive side, finishing high school early allows students to save time and energy during a crucial period in their developmental years, allowing them to focus more directly on other pursuits. In addition, leaving high school early can give students an advantage for college acceptance, scholarships, and internships. Students who are in a hurry to finish their courses may not give themselves time to fully digest the material, which can put them at a disadvantage when moving on to the next stage. 

In conclusion, it is an individual choice whether or not to finish high school early. In addition, students may miss out on certain elective classes if they cannot find enough time in their course load",1
"By promoting greater engagement with learning, encouraging student collaboration, and providing convenient access to digital resources, cell phones can be a powerful tool to enhance any educational setting.. 

The use of cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes can bring numerous advantages, both for students and teachers alike. 

Cell phones can also benefit the learning environment by providing a simple way to connect with teachers and classmates. By allowing students to take photos, watch videos, or access online resources, teachers can provide more tailored instruction, better engage with their students, and support the development of digital literacy skills. When used properly, cell phones can provide convenient access to a wealth of digital resources, improve communication between students and teachers, and encourage greater participation in class. Social media apps, instant messaging, and video conferencing can all be used to facilitate collaboration between students, while also providing teachers with a streamlined way to spread information such as assignment deadlines or upcoming events. 

For students, using cell phones in the classroom can provide a more intuitive way of engaging with educational content. 
Cell phones have become integral components of everyday life, and their presence in the classroom is no exception. As technology advances, many teachers are beginning to recognize the potential benefits of allowing students to use their cell phones for educational purposes. For example, if a teacher is introducing a new topic, they could ask students to access an online encyclopedia or search engine to learn more about the subject. For instance, a teacher could use a messaging app to deliver updates about a group project or schedule an online meeting to discuss the progress of the assignment",1

Honesty is a virtue that many of us aspire to adhere to - but is it always the best policy? The answer is not quite so straightforward. However, generally speaking, it is wise to choose honesty as it can foster strong relationships and lead towards positive growth.. It can also help to build meaningful relationships, as lies can inevitably be uncovered, which can damage relationships and damage trust. Another example may include a white lie to spare a friend from knowing the truth about a scenario which has no bearing on the outcome.

At the same time, it is important to recognize that honesty is generally the best policy. Telling the truth is a way of showing respect and demonstrating trustworthiness. On certain occasions, honesty may not always be the best policy - for instance if a person can be saved from emotional harm by telling a white lie. 

Ultimately, each situation should be judged on a case by case basis. For example, if someone you know is wearing a terrible outfit, telling them it looks great may avoid them feeling embarrassed and hurt. It is important to recognize that there are occasions when telling a lie might be necessary in order to avoid hurt feelings or potential consequences. Being honest can also help to create a sense of accountability, leading to growth as individuals and communities",1
"Conversely, if we are not able to motivate ourselves to work, we will not be able to provide for ourselves and our families, causing immense financial and emotional strain. Engaging in hobbies, spending time with friends and family, or even taking a walk around the block can help to relieve stress and create a more positive outlook on life. Taking on too much work without finding time for leisure activities leads to increased stress and frustration, and can even lead to physical illnesses – such as headaches, fatigue, and a weakened immune system. While work is necessary in order to make money and provide for ourselves and our families, it must be balanced with leisure activities in order to remain happy and healthy. 

By balancing our work with leisure activities, we are able to remain happy and stress-free. Furthermore, having the financial security and freedom that comes from being responsible and working hard also increases feelings of contentment.

In conclusion, it is clear that having a balanced lifestyle of both work and leisure activities is beneficial to our overall well-being. 
Having a balanced lifestyle of work and leisure activities is paramount to a healthy, fulfilling life. 

Without balance, we can quickly become overwhelmed and burnt out either by dedicating too much of our time to work, or vice versa. Making the conscious effort to maintain a balance lifestyle provides us with a sense of satisfaction, security, and joy.",1
"He once said “Our greatest glory is not in never failing, but in rising up every time we fail.” We can draw inspiration from these words and use them as motivation when we face obstacles or setbacks on our path to success. It may not be easy but, as Emerson said, “What lies behind us and what lies before us are small matters compared to what lies within us.” We should remember this and be resilient in the pursuit of our dreams.. But the journey wasn’t easy - I had to work hard, face rejection and put in extra hours outside of my day job. Despite family members discouraging me, I set my sights on a career in the arts. 

At the end of the day, resilience is a valuable tool that can help us to reach any goal with optimism and courage. 

For me, resilience has been key to achieving my dreams. 

Through resilience, we can persevere and remain strong, even when presented with adversity. However, I kept going and never gave up. 

Resilience involves maintaining a positive attitude even when the going gets tough. In time, I finally got my foot in the door and realized my goals. 
When it comes to being resilient and striving towards your goals, Ralph Waldo Emerson had some wise words. As Les Brown reminds us, ""One of the greatest gifts you can give to yourself is the gift of resilience. The ability to bounce back and rise above whatever challenges life brings."" True resilience involves focusing on the end result and never giving up - no matter how long the journey may be. Henry Ward Beecher believed that, “One unerring mark of the love of truth is not entertaining any proposition with greater assurance than the proofs it is built upon will warrant.” This teaches us to be open-minded and mindful of the circumstances and situations that we face - while remaining resilient and focused on our goals",1
"Graduating at an early age gives students the unique opportunity to explore higher education and the workforce, while also providing valuable time to build real-world experience. Students that choose to pursue this route can look forward to taking advantage of special programs and resources, furthering their education early, and taking a gap year to explore new interests.. 
Graduating high school in three years can provide many opportunities for young students that wouldn't be available in a traditional four year high school program. Furthermore, some high schools may even offer special degree programs that allow students to graduate early while earning college credit or a technical certificate. 

One great example of a successful person who achieved early graduation is Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder and CEO of Facebook. 

Finally, one of the most notable advantages for young students who choose to graduate high school in three years is the benefit of taking a gap year. At just the age of 19, Zuckerberg graduated from Harvard University after attending high school for only three years. A gap year offers students the chance to take time away from their studies to spend a year in specialized activities, such as volunteering, travel, research, and education. During this gap year, students have the unique opportunity to gain valuable skills, network, and explore new interests, all of which can provide advantages later in life.

In conclusion, graduating high school in three years can provide a variety of benefits and opportunities for young students that may not be available in the traditional four year route. Although Zuckerberg made a habit of jumping ahead of his peers, he states that he only considered graduating early after he took Advanced Placement courses during his high school years. For instance, many universities offer early admission and scholarships programs to students who choose to apply early. 

High school graduates also have the option of pursuing special opportunities that open up to them earlier if they don't take the traditional four year route",1
"Additionally, achieving this goal would help inspire others and support them on their own journey of achieving positive change.. Knowing I am taking steps to improve my body and health is likely to improve my outlook on life and make me feel more positive about myself.

Finally, I hope to reduce the risk of health complications caused by my current weight. By maintaining a healthy weight, I can reduce the strain on my body, increasing my energy levels, decreasing risk of injury and improving my overall physical fitness. Being overweight or obese can increase the risk of a variety of health conditions. Reducing my weight will decrease the strain on my body, helping to protect me from certain health complications in the future. Tracking my progress and seeing the results of my hard work will give me an immense sense of accomplishment and motivation to further improve. The three main reasons for wanting to lose weight are to improve physical health, increase self-confidence, and reduce the risk of health complications. 

Overall, achieving my goal of losing weight would help me to improve my physical health, increase self-confidence, and reduce the risk of health complications. 

To improve physical health, weight loss can help to reduce the risk of long-term health complications such as obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes. 
Losing weight has been a goal of mine for some time, however, it is important for me to identify the main reasons so I can stay focused on my goal. 

Second, I want to increase my self-confidence by losing weight",1
"It can help students take pride in their work and contribute to the larger culture of achievement. Praising students for their accomplishments creates a positive feedback loop, creating an outlook that emphasizes effort and hard work rather than perfectionism. While lofty goals are laudable, even smaller accomplishments can be empowering and show a person the value of their contribution. 

In conclusion, the source of true self-esteem is achieved through tangible accomplishments that recognize and honor a person's hard work. 

Praising great students in the learning environment can help foster a positive learning environment and encourage others to reach for their own goals. Building a strong work ethic, taking on responsibility, and working towards goals can all contribute to the development of self-esteem. 
True self-esteem comes from achievement – the knowledge that one has changed the world in some tangible way, even if only in a small corner of it. By celebrating small triumphs and successes, all can appreciate the value of their work and develop greater self-esteem.. Praising great students can create a healthy, motivational environment that encourages others to reach for their goals. By recognizing great student work, teachers can provide a source of inspiration to the students they are teaching",1

The effects of technology on society have been seen both positively and negatively. However, people’s heavy reliance on technology can also have serious consequences. It is important to understand that technology is only one tool that facilitates relationships; it should never replace human interaction.. People were largely disconnected and isolated from one another, hampered by the slow speed of communication and resulting misunderstanding of different cultures. In the present, technology has allowed people to connect across physical boundaries in ways that were previously impossible. 

To counterbalance the potential issues caused by technology, people should prioritize face-to-face interaction, foster empathy during conversations, and be mindful of their own technology use. Social movements, including those focused on education reform and civil rights, have been effectively organized through technology. This has been linked to aggressive behavior when people are told to limit their use of technology, as well as a general lack of social awareness and inability to interpret body language. 

In the past, technology had limited importance in society. Face-to-face interaction is becoming increasingly rare as people spend more time interacting with screens than with each other. As technology has advanced, it has given people the capability to exchange ideas and collaborate in ways that were not previously possible",1
"They should be low in saturated fats, trans fats, and sugar, and they should contain plenty of essential vitamins and minerals. Increasing the variety of healthy lunches will provide students with the nutrients they need to remain energized and focused throughout the day. Therefore, it's wise to change the school cafeteria menu to offer healthier food choices. Therefore, changing the menu to include nutritious meals is essential.. This is highly damaging to students’ physical and mental health. 
The school cafeteria is the main source of meals for many students, so it's essential that the food it provides is nutritious and healthy. 

Healthy meals should include more fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy products. Research has shown that improved nutrition leads to improved academic performance. These health complications can have long-term effects that interfere with learning and development. 

In addition to health problems, unhealthy food can cause poor concentration and fatigue, as well as mood swings and other behavioral problems. Unfortunately, the current menu consists of processed, unhealthy options that contain an excessive amount of sugar and salt. 

Eating unhealthy food can cause obesity and other health issues, such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes. 

By offering healthier food choices in the school cafeteria, we can ensure that students are getting the nutrition they need to stay healthy, perform better in school, and be more productive",1

Working Alone: 
- I prefer to focus on independent work as I can avoid distractions and complete tasks uninterrupted.
- Working alone allows me to make decisions quickly and complete work at my own pace without interruption.
- When I work alone, I can think more clearly and stay organized without needing to answer to anyone else.

Working with Groups: 
- Working with groups can provide a fun environment to exchange ideas, ask questions, and develop teamwork skills.
- Group projects allow everyone to contribute ideas and skills to the same project in ways I can not do alone.
- Working with other people motivates me to push myself further and learn more.",1
"Sharing ideas with others can open us up to different perspectives and allow us to think outside the box. Moreover, talking to people can provide us with valuable insight from various perspectives and allow us to make more informed decisions. From holding team meetings to encouraging creative dialogue between peers, seeking various ideas and opinions can prove to be a powerful tool in helping to make the right decision.. For instance, research has suggested that taking a collaborative approach to decision making can help to create greater success in professional settings. 
When it comes to making important decisions, it is often beneficial to seek advice and ideas from many different people",1
"In addition, the younger students can act as mentors of their own in terms of their grasp of technology, familiarity with digital media, and the latest trends in youth culture. Finally, the overall collaboration between the two ages can bridge the gap in knowledge and experience, creating an open and symbiotic atmosphere of learning.. 
Mentoring programs that pair older and younger students come with many benefits. For example, an older student may be able to provide an inside view of a college or offer tips on applying for scholarships. Firstly, older students can use their knowledge to help their younger colleagues, as they will likely have more experience and insights to share",1

Excerpt:
The notion that example is the main thing that influences others has been around for centuries. The second experience was when I entered the professional world and noticed how my presence, attitude, and professionalism had a tremendous effect on the people around me. My co-workers responded to my enthusiasm and commitment to my job, and I witnessed tangible results in the organization's success. They began to mimic my mannerisms and behaviors, and even started adopting some of my interests. From these two experiences, it is clear that example is a powerful and influential thing.. This idea has been proven true in my own life through two distinct experiences. The first experience was when I was a teenager and I noticed how my behavior and the way I carried myself had a direct impact on my friends",1
"This can lead to students feeling calmer and more focused when the new term starts. 

Making schools year round could have a number of potential benefits for students and teachers alike, providing students with the necessary resources and opportunities to succeed academically while also promoting a healthier lifestyle. With such a change, school holidays would need to be structured differently, but it could provide more consistent learning opportunities for students throughout the year.. Having a more balanced learning pattern can also help to reduce stress experienced during peak periods such as exam periods and motivation levels. 

Longer winter breaks can often be beneficial for students to enjoy time with family and friends, as well as providing the opportunity to engage in leisure activities and mental health-promoting activities, such as skiing or snowboarding. Having a short week-long break in each season of the year- such as fall, winter and spring - can help to refresh, relax and restore both the mind and body, helping to promote academic success. Shorter summer breaks, like 3-4 week long holidays, enable students to maintain a steady learning cadence throughout the year, rather than having to absorb large capacities of knowledge after an extended holiday. 

One potential benefit of making schools year round is that students may retain knowledge for longer without having to reinvest in the same topic after lengthy school breaks, leading to greater learning outcomes and better long-term memory. 
Short summer breaks may provide a number of advantages to students, such as the opportunity to recharge and relax for a few weeks leads to refreshed minds and healthier bodies, allowing students to return to school with renewed energy and enthusiasm",1
"With a comprehensive and well-rounded education, four year high school helps set the foundation for a successful future.. By spending an additional year, students have more time to take challenging classes, explore their interests, and get involved in various activities. They can also hone their skills in areas such as writing, communication, and problem-solving, which are invaluable tools in college and beyond. Furthermore, the extra year provides an opportunity to gain a better understanding of career pathways and build connections with professionals in the field. 
Attending a four year high school, rather than a three year one, can offer a wealth of educational opportunities and experiences",1
"For students, such a policy might provide an incentive to take their studies more seriously as there would be direct and immediate consequences for below-average grades. 

For teachers, this policy could mean lower stress levels and a more productive learning environment. Additionally, it could offer a structure that encourages scholastic success, since those students who are motivated to achieve higher grades would be rewarded with chances to participate in school activities. Not only would the teacher be able to focus on quality instruction rather than attempting to encourage a struggling student, but the other students would also be more engaged in their learning, encouraged by the absence of any disruption caused by a student with below-average grades.

Ultimately, by communicating the consequences of underperforming in their classes, a policy like this could be an effective tool for improving both student performance and overall school environment.. 
Implementing a policy where any student receiving a grade of less than a C in class would be excluded from participating in school activities could have several benefits for students and teachers alike",1

My dream is to become a professional engineer and make a positive impact in the world. It is important to me because I want to create sustainable solutions that will make people's lives better and help solve some of the world's most pressing problems. 

At the same time, I understand that it is important to take time to relax and trust myself. It allows me to think through different scenarios and evaluate different outcomes. Taking time to relax and reflect helps me gain valuable insight that is required when making decisions. Taking a closer look at their paths, I have noticed the importance of the right mentors and team members. 

To gain insight into what it takes to achieve my dream, I have studied different stories of successful individuals. Overall, giving myself the time to trust in my own decision-making process is critical in order to reach my goal.. While some people may choose to work alone, a team can provide invaluable guidance, support, and help make your dreams a reality. From looking at their stories, I have learned the importance of hard work, dedication, and perseverance. Some of the most successful people don't just rely on an external team to achieve their goals; they learn to trust in their own abilities and make decisions based on their own understanding. To achieve my dream, I'm planning to dedicate myself to academic excellence, gaining experience in research and internships, and building my professional network",1

For a more lively experience, a trip to one of the many bustling Japanese markets is a must. One of the most iconic sights are the blossom trees that bloom for a brief two week period in the spring. The country is awash with a sea of pink and white petals as the sakura, or cherry blossom, trees provide a stunning display of nature's beauty. Not only can visitors find the perfect souvenir, but the crowded aisles filled with people provides a real glimpse of the Japanese spirit..

"These should be weighed against each other prior to reaching a decision to ensure that the choice made is the best option for the individual and their future.. Alternatively, seeking external guidance such as advisors, family, or educational programs can give the student an outside perspective and information not available to them individually. If the student solely makes the decision on their own, they may feel more in control and the process more authentic. However, depending largely on their own knowledge may lead them to miss out on other potential options or choices that could have been beneficial to their future. 

Take the example of a college student deciding what degree to pursue. Seeking external guidance, particularly from trusted and knowledgeable sources, can help someone become better informed in their decision-making and weigh their options. However, reliance on outside help can also lead to an inability to make decisions independently, which can take away an individual's autonomy in their decision-making. 
Decision-making is an important life skill that has potential implications for someone's future. making decisions independently or seeking guidance from experts and authorities can have both advantages and disadvantages. 

Ultimately, making decisions involves both advantages and disadvantages of independent or external guidance that can affect the individual and their future. Though seeking outside help can potentially lead to the student feeling less autonomy and sense of freedom, this can be beneficial to their future decision-making as they will be more informed and aware of the process",1

"We can and should be critical of ourselves in order to improve, but we must keep the correct perspective: we are unique and special, just as we are, and no amount of external accomplishment is necessary to validate us.. 

As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.” People would be better off if they relearned to accept and value their true selves rather than striving to live up to some unattainable definition of perfection. 
It’s easy to feel overwhelmed with the thought that our lives are supposed to be something other than they are. Our society has inundated us with images of ‘perfect’ lives, each one more unattainable than the last. It’s no wonder that so many people are trying to be something they’re not—and then feeling unhappy and unfulfilled when they fail. We judge ourselves against an arbitrary standard of material wealth, beauty, and success that can lead to a damaging cycle of self-judgment",1
"The students may be so focused on completing the service requirements that they neglect to focus enough time and energy on their studies. By formulating this solution, students, community, and government can all benefit.. However, community service can also teach valuable life lessons such as compassion, empathy, collaboration, and communication, which can have a positive effect on academic performance. By allowing students to customize their service, they can optimize their time to ensure both their academic and personal needs are met. Finally, the government should provide incentives for students who choose to do community service beyond the required minimum, such as scholarship and volunteer awards. Additionally, this solution would empower students to serve their community in a way that suits their interests and passions.  

A potential solution to this issue would be to allow students to choose the type and amount of community service they take part in. 
After reviewing several studies on the pros and cons of requiring students to do community service, it appears that the primary concern is the potential impact on academic performance",1
"Kindness isn’t meant to be measured—it’s meant to be shared. Even in the toughest of times, small acts of kindness like a smile, lending a hand to a friend in need, or simply being a good listener can be enough to hold onto hope and stay positive. The dawn of a new day, a cool breeze on a summer evening, or the beauty of a sunset can all be enjoyed by reaching out and extending a kind gesture to someone who might be struggling. Kindness can help us to appreciate the little moments that make life special. In doing so, we give them the opportunity to experience a moment of joy and relief.

We are all connected, and kindness has an infinite ripple effect. In the face of difficulty, an act of kindness, no matter how small, can provide some light in the darkness. It has the power to lift us up, keep us positive, and most importantly, seize the day no matter the circumstances.. 
It is easy to feel overwhelmed by the trials and tribulations that life throws our way. 

When faced with adversity, it can be easy to forget that even the smallest acts of kindness are enough to make a difference. As such, no act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted. Whether it’s a gesture of tenderness, compassion, or simply a listening ear, kindness is a healing balm to the soul. However, something that we should never forget is the value of a single act of kindness",1
"On the other hand, opponents of curfews argue that restricting movement of young people unfairly interferes with their basic rights, and stifles creativity and personal development.

In some cases, curfews have been effective in curbing juvenile crime in particular areas. 

Proponents of curfews argue that they reduce the likelihood of crime and that they can also act as a parental tool for monitoring their child's activities. 
    Curfews are laws or regulations that restrict the movement of teenagers in public places during certain hours of the day, usually at night. It appears that curfews can be useful in keeping teenagers out of trouble in some cases, however, they can also interfere with their rights and limit their activities in other cases. They are often instituted by governments or private organizations such as schools, in order to protect teenagers from engaging in risky or illegal behavior. The efficacy of curfews ultimately depends on the particular situation and context in which they are instituted.. For example, in the city of Oakland, California, local officials observing a decrease in crime in areas where the curfew was introduced. On the other hand, there are also cases where curfews have had a detrimental impact on young people. For instance, in the United Kingdom, an 11pm curfew introduced during the coronavirus outbreak has had adverse effects on teenagers' mental health, with some feeling isolated and lonely due to the lack of social contact.

In conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages associated with curfews",1

Overall, having an after school program is a beneficial endeavor for both students and teachers. These programs offer the ability for both students and teachers to apply the knowledge they have gained throughout the school day, something that is essential for career and academic success. 

Having an after school program provides crucial insight into real-world scenarios and fosters students’ extracurricular abilities. Through creative, hands-on learning, students stay ahead in their classes and gain a better understanding of their overall academic performance. It presents students with essential leadership and problem-solving skills that help them excel beyond a learning environment. 
After school programs have become increasingly popular for both students and teachers. It encourages knowledge application, promotes career and academic success, and allows students and teachers the opportunity to cultivate skills they may not possess in the classroom setting.. Through after school programs, students and teachers have the chance to volunteer to help others understand or finish tasks, which not only reinforces their knowledge but also promotes camaraderie and team-building skills. Not only do they provide students and teachers with the opportunity to learn new material, but they also allow for the chance to gain better grades on quizzes and tests. For teachers, after school programs can provide unique perspectives on certain topics that can be applied in their classroom materials",1

I believe my experience and qualities make me an ideal candidate for the position, and am excited to take part in such a varied and stimulating environment.. I understand the importance of working collaboratively, and also how to remain focused in a productive learning environment. 
The organization I am applying for offers numerous opportunities to those seeking to gain new skills and experience in a vibrant learning environment. This organization allows for up to 20 participants in each class, and uses a number of different teaching methods to ensure the most effective learning outcome is achieved. I am also self-motivated and not afraid to take initiative, often finding creative solutions to problems or taking the lead during group tasks and activities",1
"On the other hand, having a policy that does not allow phones during school lunch can help create an environment that is less distracting for both students and staff. On the one hand, having a policy that allows the use of phones during school lunch can create a more relaxed atmosphere and provide students with an opportunity to unwind and connect with friends and family outside of the classroom. This can allow students to focus on their lunch and conversations with their peers, while providing a break from constant phone use. Ultimately, each school will need to decide which policy is appropriate for its setting, in order to create a safe and supportive school environment.. Furthermore, allowing phones during lunch can make it easier for students to access educational resources, such as online dictionaries and fact-checking websites. 
One way school administrators can attempt to create an environment conducive to learning is by regulating the use of phones during school lunch. Additionally, not allowing phones during lunch can also reduce the risk of data misuse, as students become less exposed to social media and online services",1
"

On the other hand, one of the biggest downsides to the three-year program is the potential limited exposure to different classes and other learning opportunities. While it can help students get to college sooner and reduce the cost of tuition, the limited exposure to different classes and social aspects should be taken into account before making a decision.. 

On the positive side, students can graduate high school one year sooner than if they had followed the tradition four-year program. High school students might not have the time to develop the critical thinking and problem-solving skills needed in the college environment if they don’t have access to a full range of classes. Also, the loss of the extra year of high school could make it harder to transition socially and might add an extra level of stress as students try to adapt to college life. While the program offers some advantages, there are also several potential drawbacks that must be considered. Additionally, students who are looking to pursue specialized education pathways or training can benefit from the three-year program by entering college sooner and gaining that extra year of experience before entering the workforce. This can make college easier to manage by eliminating extra financial expenses and allowing students more time to focus on their studies. 

The three-year high school program has both advantages and disadvantages for students. 
The three-year high school program is an alternative to the traditional four-year cycle that can help students graduating early, save tuition costs, or enter college earlier",1
"However, this decision carries many far-reaching implications that ultimately make such a move inadvisable.

First and foremost, reducing teacher work hours would likely result in an increase in class sizes. Teachers dedicate a great deal of time to their work and, by painting it as something that can be accomplished in a short amount of time, we risk giving the impression that it is a less worthy profession worth less than those requiring more working hours.

For these reasons, reducing work hours for school teachers is not a wise decision. While it may provide teachers with greater leisure time, it is important to weigh the implications and maintain the respect and integrity due to the education system.. 
The debate over reducing work hours for school teachers is one that has caused much contention in recent years. It would also add additional strain on teachers, who would be responsible for teaching more material to a larger class in reduced time frames.

In addition, fewer teacher work hours could lead to the primary instructors being asked to take on additional roles in the school, such as extracurricular activities and guidance support. This would detract from the crucial educational focuses of their role, and could lead to compromising standards as they would now be trying to manage more complex tasks in fewer work hours.

Lastly, reducing the amount of time teachers spend in the classroom could unintentionally devalue the profession as a whole. This would lead to an overall decrease in the quality of education provided, as it becomes increasingly difficult for a teacher to manage a larger number of students. On the surface, it appears to be a reasonable notion; reducing the hours teachers spend in the classroom would limit their exposure to stress and provide more leisure time",1
"With a greater emphasis on student outcomes and future prospects, it is important to consider the impact of changes to school hours on a student's future and achievement. It is important to ensure that students are provided with the necessary support and resources to begin and continue their education, while also being able to study and work concurrently. Additionally, the difficulty which some students may have in adjusting to a different language can lead to bullying in school, and consequently result in a lack of motivation to continue. 
The modern education system is constantly adapting to meet the changing needs of students. Furthermore, the effect of limiting traditional school hours needs to be considered; by conserving energy and resources, such an approach could reduce the environmental impact of education, though the consequences of such a shift would need to be carefully analyzed.",1

Our society today often tends to favor conformity over individuality due to certain social pressures that limit creative thinking and encourage sameness. People are often judged harshly for expressing their own thoughts or ideas that deviate from what is considered “normal”. This can be seen in the way people think, dress, and act, opting for the safety of conformity and the group mindset in order to fit in. This mentality can also be found in the job market, where having unique skills or ideas are often not valued and may even be seen as a disadvantage. In conclusion, in our society today, conformity is often favored over individuality.. People prefer certainty and will often limit their independent thinking in order to blend in. As the essay mentions, “Conformity facilitates consensus and thus generates security and stability within a society” (Goodman, 2018)",1
"Instead of automatically assuming that one’s preexisting thoughts are correct, hearing other perspectives allows for critical thought and the formation of more rounded opinions. While it is perfectly normal to have strong opinions, it is also essential to remain open to the views and experiences of others.. Constructive criticism can be a powerful tool when evaluating someone’s suggestion. An open dialogue can further develop someone’s ideas, as well as enhance the discussion by providing further insight. By taking the time to consider the variety of ideas that are out there, we give ourselves the opportunity to make more informed decisions. 
Listening to different opinions is essential for approaching issues objectively and avoiding bias. In the same way, relying on the expertise of others provides a breadth of knowledge when looking at any particular topic",1
"From there, create a plan to keep track of your progress and set deadlines for yourself to ensure that the work is completed on time. Before you start your project, it is important to brainstorm ideas, jot them down on paper, and then research the topic to get a better understanding of what is needed. Furthermore, once the work is finished, take a step back and proofread on paper before submitting for final review..

In recent years, many businesses have adopted a four-day work week with ten hour days. A longer school day could be tiring, demotivating, and overwhelming for some students, leading to burnout and deteriorating academic performance. 

From a student's perspective, more school time holds potential clerical benefits. This model raises an interesting question for schools: would extending the school day by two hours provide any benefits? There are pros and cons to consider when it comes to a longer school day. 

Overall, while there is a lot of potential for a two-hour longer school day to be beneficial for students and schools, there are also potential drawbacks such as fatigue, financial implications, and logistical challenges that must be taken into consideration.. Additionally, longer days would provide more opportunities for engaging in school culture with peers, creating a holistic learning environment. At the same time, schools should consider budget implications of hiring additional staff and the logistical implications of providing transportation for later hours. 

For schools, an extended school day provides a great opportunity to provide students with more valuable learning experiences. 

A two-hour longer school day, however, could also have a few drawbacks. Having two extra hours every day would mean more time to complete difficult topics or extra-curricular activities such as sports, music, or art. Schools could offer a wider variety of courses and extra-curricular activities, having access to more resources and training for teachers. It may also be challenging for parents to find childcare coverage for these extended hours, which could especially be a problem for single-parent households",1

One of the key benefits of getting advice from multiple people before making a decision is that you can get a broader range of perspectives. It can also help you make a more informed decision, as each person may have different experiences that you can draw on. Taking all this into account can help you make a more well-rounded decision that takes into account a variety of perspectives.. Hearing different ideas and opinions can help you gain new insights and ideas which you may not have thought of before. Getting multiple people’s perspectives can also offer valuable feedback which can help you identify any potential issues that you might not have considered before",1
"This example highlights why it is important to use the correct verb in writing, which can be done by being thoughtful with one's word choice and referencing a dictionary if a certain verb is not certain.

On the other hand, if the wrong verb is used on purpose or with the intention to deceive the reader, then the consequences of using the wrong verb can be much more serious. 

For example, if a sentence states that someone ""ran quickly"" instead of ""sprinted quickly,"" the reader may assume the subject was running at a leisurely pace. 

In conclusion, it is critical to always use the correct verb when writing. Using the right verb can add clarity and accuracy to a sentence and help ensure that the intended meaning is accurately conveyed. Additionally, if the wrong verb is used in a legal or professional document (such as in a contract or court filing) the consequences can be especially dire, as wrong verb usage can potentially invalidate the document and lead to further scrutiny and allegations of fraud. While simply using the wrong verb will not always lead to detrimental results, it is important to understand the potential consequences of such errors and to take the necessary steps to ensure verb accuracy when composing any document.. 
Verbs are an essential part of the English language and play a key role in our writing. However, using the wrong verb can cause confusion and misinterpretation, which can lead to miscommunication",1

"David was barely passing his classes and, as a result, his future career plans were delayed.

These two cases illustrate the key differences between staying occupied and being inactive. She stayed motivated and productive throughout the application process and was ultimately accepted into her dream school. 

Alternatively, David, a college freshman, struggled to stay productive and inactive lifestyle kept him from achieving his goals. For example, Laura, a high school senior, set an ambitious goal to be accepted into her first-choice college. Studies have consistently shown that proactively completing tasks is more beneficial than procrastinating or being inactive. 

Case studies of teenagers have revealed that staying occupied and productive can help lead to successful goal achievement. Staying occupied is essential for goal achievement, while being inactive can have a negative impact on life ambitions.. 
Staying occupied has a number of benefits, from increased mental health to greater overall satisfaction with life. Higher productivity leads to better goal achievement and overall success",1
"Those who do not take action at some point in their lives and instead choose to sit and wait for something to happen are much less likely to reach success. This is, however, an incorrect view to take. 
The idea of always striving to do something in order to improve one's life is a widely accepted view that is here to stay. If we look back at examples in history, there is a clear correlation between taking action and reaching success. Furthermore, if we look at our own lives, any time we took action we moved closer towards our goals. Whether in school, at work, or even in sports, we can identify times when we moved closer to success because of action.

In conclusion, the idea of taking action in order to reach success is valid, and it is proved time and time again by history and our personal experiences. Sitting and waiting for something to happen will almost never lead to success; rather, taking action as consistently as possible is much more likely to bring us closer to reaching our goals.. Not only did she become the first African-American billionaire, she also created many platforms to help empower women around the world. For example, Oprah Winfrey grew up with little opportunity and faced immense poverty growing up; however, she pursued every opportunity she had, and became one of the most successful individuals in the world. Examining successful individuals is a great way to illustrate this point. 

Opposing this view, some may argue that taking action is not the sure-fire way to reach success",1

Take the example of YouTube star, Pewdiepie, for example. His attempts at pursuing a higher education were thwarted, and he felt he had nowhere to go with his life. Before his stardom, Pewdiepie felt like he had been defeated by the world. In the end, Carrey became one of the most successful and acclaimed actors of all time.

These inspiring stories show that no matter how dire a situation may seem, it is important to never give up. Through hard work, dedication, and a commitment to staying true to himself, he has since become the most subscribed YouTube channel in the world, amassing 86 million subscribers.

Another example of why people should not give up even when they feel they can’t go on lies in the inspiring story of Jim Carrey. He didn’t allow his older circumstance to dictate his own future. He could be found sleeping in his van or sending messages to casting agents at night. Before achieving fame, Carrey was living in poverty. So, keep pushing through and tackling life head on. Instead, he pooled his resources to start his own YouTube channel, and went to work. People who have the courage to keep going, no matter what, are always able to reach great successes that they couldn’t have imagined reaching before. You never know what amazing opportunities and successes might be waiting for you in the future.. But Pewdiepie refused to give up. The people that do give up end up regretting it, while those who keep persevering can achieve the success they always wanted. 
No matter how hard life may become, or how much it seems like you have been mastered in something, it is important to remember that it’s important to never give up",1
"From my research, I have learned of the tremendous responsibility nurses have in preserving and extending people's lives through preventive healthcare and therapeutic interventions. 

To gain a deeper understanding of the nursing field, I have explored various volunteer opportunities in my local area. This internship can provide countless benefits, such as sharpening clinical skills, widening professional networks, and building practical knowledge within the healthcare field. Furthermore, this internship offers an invaluable opportunity to gain experience over the summer break with the potential for future career prospects.. I have extensively researched this amazing profession by reading books, scouring online resources, and listening to stories from current and former nurses. 
Nurses play an integral role in healthcare, providing invaluable services to those in need. One particularly attractive project is interning at a hospital known for its high reputation in the VA area",1
"It should also be made clear that teachers and school administration will be monitoring smartphone use in the classroom, and that the students should understand the consequences of not abiding by the rules. 
Smartphones can be a major distraction in the classroom. It is important to have open dialogue with parents about the role of smartphones in the classroom and the potential dangers of being too addicted or immersed in technology. Educators should emphasize that smartphones can be a positive tool when used responsibly, such as for researching specific topics and connecting with other students, but that their use can become a distraction if not monitored properly. 

In order to properly address how to handle smartphones in the classroom, schools should consider the impacts it can have on families. In addition, having a smartphone in the classroom can be a major source of peer social comparison and rivalry, leading to a disruption of the learning environment. 

By thoughtfully discussing and communicating the importance of not using smartphones in classrooms with parents and students, we can create an environment where learning is the main priority and the use of technology in the classroom is seen as an educational tool, rather than as a source of distraction. . Having policies in place which focus on using smartphones to promote learning rather than distract from it is important. When a student is using a phone, there should be clear rules for being respectful of classmates, not engaging with inappropriate content, and not overusing the phone during class time. 

Parents should be aware of the risks associated with the use of smartphones in the classroom. With the capability of providing non-stop access to the Internet, smartphones can be used to access emails, videos, games, and even social media platforms, which can result in students becoming easily diverted from learning",1

When I was in high school, I was determined to get a full-time job for the summer in order to save up money for college. It took hard work and dedication, but I eventually found a job as a cashier in a local grocery store. This experience taught me the power of hard work and determination. No matter how big or small the goal might be, so long as I stay focused, stay determined, and work hard to make it happen, I know I can achieve greatness.. Despite the fact that it wasn't the most glamorous job, I showed up to work on time, hit my goals, and even worked extra shifts.

My hard work and determination paid off in the end. Not only did I save enough money for college, but I also gained valuable work experience and earned the admiration of my supervisors, who promoted me to a managerial position",1
"When we take the time to consult with different people and listen to their perspectives, we can come up with a larger variety of solutions to any given problem. 
One of the main reasons to consider getting multiple opinions when making a decision is to get a better idea of all available choices. By hearing out different ideas and exploring different approaches to a problem, we can come up with more options than we would have thought of on our own. This was true for me when deciding which college to attend. This gave me a better idea of which option would be better for me in the long run.

Another advantage of seeking multiple opinions is that it can give us more choices to choose from. When we hear out a variety of opinions, it often gives us the assurance needed to make the right call. By talking with other people, I was able to gain the clarity that was necessary for me to trust myself and make the best choice. It can provide us with a better understanding of all available choices, more options to choose from, and the confidence needed to make a good decision.. For instance, when I faced a dilemma between taking two opportunities that were both good options, getting multiple opinions allowed me to better understand the advantages and disadvantages of each one. Consulting with multiple people exposed me to a variety of perspectives, which helped me to discover new opportunities that I wouldn’t have been aware of otherwise.

Lastly, getting multiple opinions can provide us with the confidence we need to make a good decision. 

In conclusion, getting multiple opinions when making a decision can be beneficial in many ways. This was the case when I had to decide between two very different paths to pursue after graduating high school",1
"

For Hispanic students, finishing school in three or four years could mean completing their educational requirements sooner in order to secure a job and support their families. This could give them increased access to more opportunities than other students. 
After researching the advantages and disadvantages of finishing school in three or four years, I determined that it can sometimes be beneficial for a student to finish school in one year early. Working full-time means that they could gain valuable job experience but might have less time for studying or extracurricular activities. 

American students also have advantages and disadvantages when it comes to leaving school early or working full-time. On the other hand, finishing school in three or four years could help American students accelerate their career paths and graduate with less debt. It allows students to gain a more comprehensive educational experience while still allowing them the opportunity to join the job market at a younger age.. 

Considering all the advantages and disadvantages for Hispanic and American students, I believe that finishing school in three or four years is usually the best option. On the other hand, some Hispanic students may prefer to stay in school to enrich their educational experience or to delay entering into the job market",1
"With my new job came an entirely new set of opportunities. 

In conclusion, having a positive attitude has enabled me to achieve success in life, particularly in job search, interpersonal relationships, and personal development. This type of attitude helped to foster a sense of mutual trust amongst us, as well as a willingness to work together. Even if times get tough, I know that I can rely on my own inner strength and resilience to get through it. The knowledge and skills I gained from my past job proved to be advantageous. It has helped me to better understand how to take advantage of the opportunities that come my way, create meaningful relationships with others, and continuously challenge and grow myself.. It has enabled me to approach each situation with an optimistic outlook. 
Having a positive attitude is essential for success in any aspect of life, including job searching, developing interpersonal relationships, and personal development. By staying optimistic, I was more likely to approach each of them with an open-mind and a good sense of humour. 

Furthermore, having a positive attitude has also impacted my personal development. I was able to use these assets to find a job that I truly enjoyed - one that would challenge and reward me. 

I was recently laid off from my job, but I refused to let it define or dampen my outlook on life. To better understand the importance of having a positive attitude, let me use my own story as an example. Instead, I decided to take it as an opportunity to find my true passion and use it to build the life I had always wanted. 

Having a positive attitude also helped me develop stronger relationships with my co-workers. Focusing on the positive and looking for the good in every situation has allowed me to learn from each experience, enabling me to constantly grow and further my personal development",1
"Groups can make it easier for college students to learn and comprehend difficult material, because they can collaborate on ideas, provide different solutions, and work together to come up with the best answer. Groups also provide a safe space where students can ask questions without feeling embarrassed or intimidated. Working in groups can also give teachers more time to help individual students with their unique needs, as the other students in the group are doing the work.

In conclusion, working in groups in the classroom can be a productive and beneficial experience for both the students and the teachers. 
Working in groups could be both beneficial and productive for both the students and the teachers. The different activities and collaborative work in groups can help students to better understand the material, while the different teaching methods used can engage the students and make the learning process more enjoyable.. For teachers, groups can be a great way to keep the students engaged - it encourages students to participate in the lesson and become part of the process, rather than passively listening to a lecture.

Using group work also allows for different teaching styles and methods to be used by the teacher, like simulations, group games, and problem-solving activities. These activities can help to give students an in-depth understanding of the content by providing a more hands-on approach that encourages critical thinking",1
"Plus, I can observe all of the tranquil nature around me. In addition, the park provides a great way to connect with the people around me. We like to picnic, play catch, and take a stroll around the area. For starters, I love to go for a jog around the park's path a few times a week. 

I love visiting the park! It's the perfect place for me to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature while also getting some physical exercise. On weekends, I love to bring my family to the park and spend some quality time together. It allows me to keep my body in shape, stay active, and enjoy some fresh air. From cute family moments to bonding with friends, the people I meet at the park always bring a smile to my face. Ultimately, the park is a great place to relax, take a break from the stresses of life, and enjoy the beauty of the world!. This time allows us to share quality memories and unwind",1

There are three key reasons why teachers should encourage students to work together. First, it allows students to develop vital collaboration and conflict resolution skills which will benefit them when they enter the workplace. In order for students to get the most out of group work, teachers should actively facilitate the process. Teachers should also be sure to assign tasks to individuals within the group as this helps provide accountability. Second, it can lead to an increase in creative thinking and problem-solving abilities as class members work together to tackle complex tasks. By providing students with the opportunity to work together, teachers can help cultivate important skills that can be applied to the classroom and beyond. Finally, group work gives students the opportunity to share their knowledge and learn from one another. As such, it is important that teachers create a supportive environment for group work to thrive.. 

Overall, working in a group has the potential to be very beneficial for students. For example, class members could work together to design a marketing campaign for a new product, present their perspectives on a case study, or choose a topic for a group research paper. 

Activities that are best suited for group work include ones that require problem-solving, research, debate, or peer-support. 
 Working in a group has many distinct advantages over solo work. They can do this by establishing clear expectations for the project, providing supportive guidance to help keep the group on task, and outlining roles and responsibilities. It encourages the exchange of ideas between classmates, and provides an opportunity for them to collaborate and combine resources. Group work also helps to foster and develop students’ social and communication skills",1
"Reflecting on the importance of failure on the path to success, it is an integral role and often presents learning opportunities when things don't go the way they were planned. 
""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts,"" said Winston Churchill. Not only that, but failing gives us the chance to build underlying strength, resilience and perseverance that help propel us on our journey towards success. With each failure, people gain insight into what went wrong and can learn how to improve the situation next time. Not only can failure bring about success, but it often makes us better human beings, with strong character traits that help us succeed in the long run.",1

To make biking even more enjoyable, there are a few things to keep in mind. Additionally, check the weather before leaving and make sure to bring the necessary protective clothing and sunscreen. Bringing along food, drinks, and snacks is essential for keeping energy levels up on long rides; it can also be useful to bring along friends and family to enjoy the experience together. Exploring new places around town or simply taking a leisurely ride to spend time with friends and family can provide an excellent way to make the most of summertime. Biking can be a great way to get to a variety of places quickly and enjoy the scenery along the way",1

Many argue that longer summer vacations would be beneficial to children and teenagers, as it would provide them with more time to relax and enjoy themselves. 

However, opponents of longer summer vacations suggest that additional days away from school could lead to a decline in academic performance. Additionally, a longer summer vacation could provide more opportunity for learning through activities such as volunteer work, internships, or travel experiences that might not be available during the school year. This would be especially useful during times of high stress, such as final exams, when students need to find ways to de-stress from their rigorous studies. Additionally, such a decrease in structure and routine could be damaging to children’s development, and intense summer courses may be the only solution to catch up after a longer absence from the classroom. At the end of the day, students need to find a balance between taking a break to rest and restoring their motivation for learning.. As students would be away from their learning environment for a prolonged period, it could be difficult for them to stay on track with their studies and apply new skills in a timely fashion. 

Ultimately, whether a longer or shorter summer vacation is preferable depends on a variety of factors",1

The implementation of a school homework club could be beneficial in alleviating student stress, providing a place for collaboration and peer-mentoring, and boosting academic performance. Ultimately, with careful thought and organization, a homework club can be a beneficial addition to a school’s programming.. On the other hand, there are some issues that must be taken into consideration before implementing a homework club. For example, the cost of hiring tutors and staff for the club, the stress this may cause for those already struggling with school, the need for a clearly-defined structure, and the need to ensure that the club is not just competitive but also encouraging and supportive of all students. Additionally, it is important to consider how the club may alter students’ regular routine and the need to provide adequate security and supervision for the club",1

However, there are also disadvantages to working in a team due to conflicting opinions or lack of clear communication. Furthermore, group work can also be more efficient, as tasks can be delegated among team members and achieved faster than working alone. It is therefore important to familiarize oneself with successful techniques for group work such as properly outlining the task, understanding the strengths of each group member, setting clear goals, and creating guidelines for communication. By following these techniques, you can ensure that the collaborative work experience is successful and that the group can achieve their shared goals.. 
When exploring the benefits of working in a group versus working alone, it is clear that there are many advantages to engaging in collaborative work. Group projects can provide a diverse mix of ideas, skills, and perspectives that can enhance the output of the task. Working in a team also allows for strong communication skills to be honed, which can be beneficial in both an academic and professional setting",1
"It also shows that there are people around who believe in them and trust their potential. 

To illustrate, an individual who may have previously felt lack of faith in their ability to complete a task, may receive praise from an adult for their progress thus far. 
 
Adults have an important opportunity to provide affirmation to younger individuals to support and build self-esteem. Studies have shown that we are more likely to reach goals and feel secure when we receive positive affirmations from those around us. This well-intentioned encouragement can be a large motivator for the individual, as it helps make them feel capable and affirmed in their mission. Trust in oneself and others can also help to build self-esteem, bolstering confidence and resilience. Through providing these positive affirmations, adults have the privilege of creating an encouraging atmosphere, a sense of security, and a safe environment to learn and grow.. 
Self-esteem is the foundation for feelings of self-worth and courage, and can be cultivated from positive affirmations provided by others",1
"
Studies have shown that first impressions can vary considerably depending on the context. In comparison, the first day of school may be less about the competence of the students and more about the interaction between them. For example, in a job interview, a candidate may initially make a strong impression due to their impressive qualifications, but further questioning may reveal the candidate is not as competent as originally thought. Therefore, while initial opinions of someone may be based on appearance and behavior, first impressions can quickly change based on the context of the situation. This suggests that contextually-based first impressions should always be considered with a degree of nuance.. Studies show that first impressions on this day are heavily based on non-verbal interactions, such as body language and facial expressions",1
"Emerson argues that these personal benefits are more important than the short-term gains that come from following the expectations of society.. However, Emerson argued that staying true to your own convictions and your authentic self is the key to happiness.

In conclusion, it is best to be yourself rather than be someone you are not. Staying true to yourself and embracing individualism can help you make meaningful connections, build strong relationships, and find greater satisfaction and success. 
Ralph Waldo Emerson was a prominent figure of the American Literary Renaissance of the 19th century and is widely regarded as one of the most influential writers of the era. He encouraged readers to remain true to themselves despite the external pressures and judgments from society or other people. Emerson wrote extensively about individualism and self-reliance, encouraging people to stay true to themselves and to take responsibility for their emotions, actions, and choices.

Emerson believed being yourself was one of the most important steps to achieve true spiritual self-sufficiency. According to Emerson, one can only benefit from staying true to themselves and should not be swayed by the opinions of others.

On the other hand, some people may think that it is not advantageous to be an individual self. They may argue that conforming to the norms of society is necessary for success and that individualism can be detrimental to one’s career and social life",1
"These drawbacks include possible disconnection of fathers with their children, increased strain on students, lost time for other activities important for development, and the introduction of alternative ideas to helping students succeed.. These include early start programs, where students start their day two hours earlier, or lengthening the entire school year. By keeping the school day the same but battle this pacing battle by lengthening the entire school year, schools are providing more time for students to learn and discover.

In conclusion, there are serious drawbacks to extending the school day. Fathers want to be involved in the lives of their children, so extending the school day may create tension and discontent within the home.

Second, extended school days may place too much strain on students. This not only takes time away from relaxing at home but also may cause students to become burned out and disconnected from the physical and mental activities that can improve their strengths and well-being.

Third, with an extended school day, students may not have the time to explore other activities that are important for their own development. 

Extending school by two hours has been proposed in the past as a way to improve students' academic performance and overall well-being. Although this may seem ideal on paper, this extended model is not without issue.

First, fathers may become less present and involved in their children’s lives. Such activities may include sports, music lessons, and volunteer work – activities that involve the body and the mind, and that are necessary to a rounded curriculum. With the extended school day, fathers have less time to spend with their children and, in some cases, these extra two hours are better spent in pursuit of a career or another passion. A longer day means more hours of learning and responsibility. 

Finally, there are other alternatives instead of extending the school day",1

When it comes to learning, working together in groups can be hugely beneficial. For those looking ahead to their career, working together can equip students with the key skills needed for working with different professionals in the future. 

When working on school projects, the benefits of working in a group are clear. This makes them an incredibly valuable tool for students to use in order to become more successful. These include encouraging openness in communication and active listening, meeting deadlines and setting achievable goals, as well as having a positive attitude and taking ownership of tasks. 

Finally, working together can be valuable in helping to prepare students for life after school. Ultimately, the ability to work together and problem-solve in a team can make a huge impact on the success of students later in life. Ultimately, by leveraging the power of collaboration, students can become more successful and better prepared for the future..

"Having additional time off provides necessary breathing room and can reduce stress and burn-out. 

Teachers also benefit greatly from having the extra day off. This time can be used for professional development, lesson planning, or grading. Additionally, having fewer required school days in a week gives teachers and students more time to focus on their studies and extracurriculars. Having an extra day off provides opportunities for students to spend more time on their homework, furthering their education. Moreover, by taking advantage of the additional day off, students can seek out help in areas of difficulty, or get ahead on upcoming assignments. Ultimately, a four-day school week can provide the much-needed time necessary for homework, seeking help, and investing in the community.. Instead of feeling overwhelmed with a full day of classes, teachers can have additional time for lectures and activities which can help students’ understanding. Redirecting resources saved from fewer school days to academic instruction can help to enhance the education of students. 

For students, a four-day school week can be particularly beneficial in regards to their education. The time saved on a long commute or trip to school can be used for more productive endeavors. 
For many students and teachers, a four-day school week has numerous benefits. Further, a reduction in the amount of time spent in school allows students more time for extracurricular activities, the completion of long-term projects, and exploring areas of interest. And teachers can take advantage of the extra time off and use it to better plan and acquire new skills. Parents and students alike can save money and time on gas costs to and from school.

For instance, being creative can stimulate our minds in ways that may help us face hardships in life while also providing us with a unique outlet for personal growth. Pursuing activities that make us happy, regardless of what those activities may be, can be a liberating and beneficial process. 
Living a life of joy and satisfaction can provide us with a greater sense of purpose and fulfillment. Physical activities can reduce stress and help us stay in shape, which can contribute towards overall well-being. Social activities can help us build relationships with others that bring us joy.

Too often, we are focused on conforming to what is expected of us or what feels easiest in the moment, instead of what will bring us lasting happiness. In addition, interests such as gardening, art, music, and travel, can help us get in touch with our true selves and appreciate life's simple pleasures.

"An individual could start a garden of their own and see the results come to life as they learn how to care and nurture the plants. For example, someone could make their own pizza from scratch - they can select from a variety of different toppings and sauces, experiment with different baking techniques, and taste the delicious results at the end.

A second activity that could be both enjoyable and educational is gardening. Plus, you can make it enjoyable by setting small and achievable goals and then rewarding yourself when you hit them.. Gardening is a great way to learn about plants, soil, and the environment. It can even be fun to try out different planting strategies, such as companion planting, and to see the results for yourself.

Finally, learning a new language can be both enjoyable and educational. By studying a new language, you can learn about new cultures and even new words to use in conversations. With the internet and so many apps and websites dedicated to language learning, learning a new language is more accessible than ever.

From these examples, it is clear that our first impressions can be incredibly powerful and can have a long lasting impact on our lives. However, if your first meeting with the principal is unpleasant, you are likely to treat them with distrust and antipathy, and it could color the way you view them for a long time. This can help to shape the way you feel about the world and can impact the way you interact with the people you meet from then on. It is essential to pay close attention to these initial reactions and work to make sure that they are as positive as possible. When we realize that our instinctive knee-jerk reactions and gut feelings about people and situations should be taken seriously, we realize how much of an impact they can have on our lives. 

Additionally, our first impressions can determine how we look at the world. If that first meeting goes well, chances are you will have a good attitude about this person and feel respected and welcomed. Our snap judgement of something or someone can impact us for the long haul, and this is especially true when it comes to forming lasting impressions of people. 

For instance, let’s suppose that you are starting at a new school and you have your first encounter with the principal. Whether we realize it or not, our initial impressions have a powerful impact on our relationships with other people. To illustrate this point, let’s say that you walk into a party and you are immediately met with a feeling of warmth and acceptance. 
First impressions are incredibly important, and our initial encounters with people, ideas, and experiences will often set the tone for our future relationships. On the other hand, if the party is less than hospitable, that can lead you to believe in a more hostile view of the world. By doing so, we can ensure that our relationships with people, and our outlook on life, remain healthy and upbeat.",1
"Parents have expressed mixed opinions on the effectiveness of distance learning. The effectiveness of learning from home can be questionable, as the lack of direct interaction with teachers, peers, and the campus community can make it difficult for students to maintain their focus on their education. 

Ultimately, it is important to consider that distance learning may not be the best option for students in all cases. While there can be benefits to this new setup such as avoiding the hassles of a daily commute and allowing students to pursue activities at their own pace, there are also drawbacks. While some are happy with the convenience of at-home learning, others believe that the lack of personal interaction with teachers and classmates can be detrimental to their children's overall growth and development. While some students may be able to excel in a remote learning environment, others may find it difficult to stay focused and motivated due to the lack of direct classroom engagement. 
Over the past year, many students have shifted their learning from traditional school settings to distance learning from home. As such, it is essential for parents, educators, and students to carefully evaluate the various pros and cons of distance learning and make decisions based on individual needs and circumstances.",1
"To motivate students to learn, it is important for teachers to build meaningful connections with them by providing frequent and constructive feedback on their work. It is important that both schools and students are prepared with the right tools and resources to facilitate successful distance learning. In terms of physical interaction, access to resources, and how it can affect future goals, distance learning can be either helpful or detrimental. There is also the potential for increased anxiety or decreased trust between students if teachers cannot adequately monitor their progress online - as evidence suggests higher levels of cheating and plagiarism occur in distance learning scenarios. For example, students can find it isolating and lacking in social support, while they can also benefit from having more autonomy and freedom of access to resources if they are given the right tools and facilities. 
The benefits and drawbacks of students studying from home are varied and complex. Teachers can also motivate students by setting both short- and long-term goals that can be built into assignments and tests, as well as providing extra-curricular activities such as virtual field trips, guest lectures or online meetings with industry professionals. Additionally, the cost of providing physical resources such as laptops and tablets for all students can be prohibitive. 

Schools can work to improve distance learning by offering structured systems such as virtual collaboration tools, online lecture materials, and feedback systems. With the proper systems in place, distance learning can be an effective method for students to further their education and make progress towards their goals.. 

Ultimately, students should work on school assignments from home if they feel it is beneficial and if their school is offering a comprehensive program for distance learning",1
"If the curfew is established by law, then it is punishable by law. Ultimately, it is important that parents and teens understand the consequences of breaking curfew and take the necessary steps to ensure it is followed.. For those who live in a city or state that does not have a statutory curfew, breaking curfew can still result in consequences from the parents such as restricted access to cars and phones, fewer privileges, or grounding. As an alternative to legal penalties, parents can choose to impose other forms of discipline such as discussion, restriction of privileges, or other punishments. Depending on the severity of the offense, legal penalties can range from fines to jail time. 
The potential consequences of disobeying curfew for teenagers can be severe depending on the city or state where the curfew is being enforced",1
"Dr. There is no one alive who is Youer than You.” This quote reminds me that there is nothing wrong with embracing different paths and opportunities, as long as I am true to myself.. Seuss’s words of wisdom have been a great source of comfort and guidance as I strive for a life of authenticity. He famously wrote, “Today you are You, that is truer than true. I did what I was told in order to fit in, to appease authority figures and to repay kindness and debts. 
Growing up, I was taught that adhering to the paths of others was the only sure way to achieve success. Over time, I became used to the idea that I had to do what was expected of me - but I was gradually losing my own sense of identity and purpose.

Realizing that I needed to find a balance, I began searching for ways to differentiate between external and internal pressures",1
"Taking regular breaks and varying your tasks throughout the day can help ensure you stay focused and productive.. 
The importance of focusing on a single task and avoiding idling can not be overstated. 

Overall, while focusing on a single task can be extremely beneficial and help you achieve better results, it is important to remember that there are also some limitations to be aware of. By avoiding idling and staying focused on the task at hand, we are able to get more done in less time and achieve better results. It can also be hard to maintain focus on a single task for a long period of time without becoming easily distracted due to fatigue or boredom. 

However, there are still some limitations to focusing on a single task. This focus on singular tasks allows us to dig deeper and explore the details of the task more thoroughly, making sure to not miss any important components. Additionally, if you are too focused on one task, you might become burnt out or lack enthusiasm for completing the same task on a regular basis. With so many distractions in our daily lives, it’s easy to become overwhelmed and start putting off the task at hand. By being so focused on one task, we can sometimes lose sight of the bigger picture and miss out on how the task fits into a larger set of goals and objectives",1
"To improve this skill, I plan on taking a speech class with a focus on communication techniques. 
After spending some time researching my own skills and talents, I have identified a few that I possess and have determined ways that I could improve upon them. 

Finally, I have also looked at ways to develop any new skills or abilities that I may not currently possess. After researching potential avenues for doing this, I have found methods that could help me to become the expert in whichever skills or talents I may possess. By doing this, I am opening myself up to new experiences and opportunities that I may not have been able to take advantage of otherwise. I have also researched how I can become better than others in the same fields as me. One particular skill I have is public speaking. With the possibilities being endless, I am excited to start exploring the ways I can improve upon and add to the skill-set I already possess.. I was also surprised to discover that there could be a world record associated with a skill I possess. After a bit of research, I found that there is a world record for holding the most books in one hand, which I am pretty sure I can beat! 

I have also looked for ways to combine skills or talents that I may not have thought of before, such as combining public speaking with musical performance. This type of performance could lead to exciting opportunities for me in the future",1
"But why is that? Simply put, it's because physical interaction is necessary for human connection. 
In today's modern world, technology is an integral part of everyone's lives. Furthermore, people have become dependent on technology as a crutch--they utilize it as a way to feel connected with others, even when they don't have any real human contact. Unfortunately, this has led to the limitation of physical human contact, which has had numerous negative impacts on people's health.

Recent studies have found that people who spend less time engaging in face-to-face, social interactions are more likely to suffer from depression, anxiety, and feelings of loneliness. And while the use of technology will always be necessary in our lives, we must remember to prioritize real human interaction as an essential component of our health and well-being.. From the social media platforms that people use to stay connected with others to the devices that allow us to work from anywhere in the world, technology has undeniably reshaped the way that people communicate. When I was stuck at home last year due to the pandemic, virtually every interaction I had was through a laptop or phone screen, and I really started to feel the negative effects of it. Without it, people do not get the validation and emotional support that they need in order to lead healthy and fulfilling lives. This disrupts the natural cycle of social interactions and disconnects people from reality, making it difficult for them to form meaningful relationships with others.

My own personal experience has demonstrated the importance of human contact in maintaining one's mental and physical well-being. I found myself anxious and overwhelmed, and I often felt lonely and isolated. It was only when I was able to get out of the house and meet with a few friends in-person that I was able to gain back my sense of control and calm my frazzled nerves",1
"Additionally, the convenience factor of online schooling allows students to access materials from anywhere with an internet connection, meaning they can study from anywhere. Furthermore, students can work at their own pace, without having to try and keep up with their peers. 
Online schooling provides many benefits which can further contribute to improved academic performance. For example, the lack of distractions found in a traditional classroom setting can make it easier for students to focus on their studies and better absorb the material. These individual benefits of online schooling can have a positive impact on students' academic performance.. Better sleeping schedules which can be fostered by online schooling can also help improve cognition and the ability to concentrate more easily, resulting in a better understanding of material",1
"This is an unfair practice, for several reasons.

First, it sets up a false dichotomy between academics and athletics, an artificial separation that should not exist. It is our job as educators to ensure that all students have equal opportunity to participate.. Sports, in particular, can foster resilience and provide a constructive outlet for frustration or disappointment with academic performance.

Second, using grades to limit athletics unfairly disadvantages those students who are already at a disadvantage. Students should be encouraged to excel in both areas. The flip side of this coin is that students who already excel in academics are given extra incentive to keep up their performance, while students who struggle are left behind.

Finally, and most importantly, sports activities help young people develop lifelong skills and friendships. These experiences should not be denied to students based on one area of performance. Unfortunately, access to these activities is often limited when students are required to achieve a certain grade in order to participate. Athletics is an essential part of holistic education, and too often we forget to think of it as such.

For these reasons, it is highly unfair to limit access to sports based on grade requirements. 
Sports activities are an essential part of physical and mental development in young people",1
"Furthermore, I plan to pursue leadership roles in school and community organizations, as well as complete relevant volunteer work, so that I can develop more experience and gain skills to help me excel in my chosen career.. 
I am considering becoming a computer engineer after high school, so I have done some research into what qualifications and experiences I need to prepare myself for this profession. To that end, I am taking some college-level courses in programming and mathematics that will both help me prepare for college and give me a head start on my studies. I have found that a degree in computer science or engineering from an accredited university is highly recommended, as well as the completion of internships or entry-level jobs with technology companies. Additionally, I need to have excellent problem-solving skills, knowledge of coding languages, and the ability to think outside the box. I am also researching different college programs to find the best fit for me",1
"Ineffective studying practices can lead to failure in a chosen career, but taking the time to research thoroughly and develop effective methods will provide a strong foundation for long-term success.. 
When it comes to making an informed commitment to a career, it is important to recognize the value of waiting until later in high school. The high school years are a critical time for developing knowledge and skills that can impact long-term career success. Moreover, waiting to commit to a path until later in high school can save students from investing in unsuccessful or inappropriate study practices. Taking time to explore available career options, form study habits, and seek guidance from mentors can help students to select an appropriate career track as they enter adulthood",1
"
    Throughout history, there have been endless examples of people who have turned failure into success. entrepreneur Jim Rohn famously said, “Your challenge is not to avoid mistakes, but to recognize that failure is a path to personal growth.” This emphasizes that failure should be taken as a way to grow and develop valuable skills. Despite being homeless with his son, he never gave up on his entrepreneurial dreams and went on to found his own stockbrokerage firm. Her example shows that success comes with hard work, perseverance, and optimism, even in the face of adversity. 

In conclusion, failure is just as important as success in many aspects of life. This could be because those with a negative attitude, view failure as absolute, rather than something to learn from and build upon. 

Chris Gardner is a fine example of how coming back from failure is very much possible. 

The resilience some have when faced with failure can often come from their willingness to take risks and stay optimistic about the future. Despite contracting polio when she was a toddler, she overcame it and went on to become the first American black woman to win three gold medals in the 1960 Rome Olympics. Focusing on the positive and staying motivated in the face of adversity will empower people to brush off failures more quickly and continue on towards success. People should stay motivated and optimistic when faced with failure and use it as a stepping stone towards success.. 

In contrast, failure can be discouraging or even detrimental to some. Having a growth mindset helps to keep failure from spiraling into a deeper pit of confusion and regret. Sometimes, facing failure with a negative attitude can derail success and make it harder to get motivated. Not only does it give people the opportunity to learn and grow, but it can also shape their personality and give them the confidence to take measured risks. Wilma Rudolph, a Paralympic athlete, is a powerful example of how failure can be turned into success. 

On the other hand, some people have the opinion that failure should be embraced and seen as a learning opportunity. He teaches us that success means never taking “no” for an answer, and that everyone can start again if they choose to",1
"He said, “The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.” This sentiment resonates today as we look to examples of taking risks and setting big goals. Perhaps you set a goal to pass your permit test. Taking risks and failing can be intimidating and even frightening, but it is often necessary in order to achieve greater successes. 

One example can be seen in the popular television show Masterchef. 

On a more personal level, many of us can look to our own lives for examples. Here, contestants put it all on the line in a high-stakes cook-off, showing the importance of setting big goals and having the courage to risk failure to achieve success. As Michelangelo said, “The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.” Taking risks can make us better people, and can help us to reach heights we might not have achieved otherwise.. When you find out you have passed the test, you are rewarded with the satisfaction of having taken the risk, worked hard, and accomplished your goal.

In the end, it’s important to take the advice of Michelangelo and others to heart. Taking a risk and studying hard, you take the test with the anticipation and fear of failure looming in the back of your mind. 
Throughout his life, Michelangelo was an advocate for setting ambitious goals and taking risks, regardless of the outcome",1
"The importance of acknowledging and encouraging people with positive attitudes is invaluable to any community, as it encourages an environment of growth and any form of adversity can be faced together. Research has indicated that having a positive attitude can lead to greater success, increased happiness, and greater acceptance within oneself or a community. This is because those with positive attitudes not only tend to recognize their own potential, but also are better at embracing and seeing opportunities to grow and better themselves. Moreover, personal experiences and life lessons can be a primary factor that can influence one's attitude towards life - enabling them to face challenges, stay positive even when faced with adversity, and constantly strive to be better. 
Attitude is an intangible, yet powerful factor that can influence how one lives their life and ultimately, how successful they become. 

Positive attitudes can also be infectious, enabling those with an upbeat attitude to be role models for those in their community - encouraging positivity and providing the motivation necessary to help others overcome challenges and find success. Ultimately, having a positive attitude can help individuals to unlock their full potential and have great success; it is no surprise that attitude plays an essential role in the various forms of personal success.",1
" 

This method can also provide an individual with a more in-depth understanding of the situation, as each party usually provides their personal perspective that can contextually provide more information. By doing this, one can gain perspectives from a more diverse range of sources, allowing for a more balanced and informed decision. Furthermore, by listening to a variety of counsel, one may be exposed to new ideas and solutions to a problem, reaffirming convictions or allowing for a more personalized solution. With a broad range of experiences and perspectives, gathering advice from multiple people is a tool with great potential to help someone make more thoughtful and sound decisions that can have a lasting and positive impact.. In addition, this individual can learn how to analyze a situation from multiple points of view, allowing this person to make more informed choices beyond the dilemma in question. 
Asking multiple people for advice can be a beneficial decision-making strategy. This could lead to a better choice than what might be derived from a single opinion. 
       
Overall, seeking advice from different people can be an invaluable asset that can help someone greatly in life, both in the short-term and long-term",1
"It is important to recognize the potential risks and difficulties, but also have an underlying positive outlook which encourages progress. With this situation, an individual may be too eager to believe that any obstacles can be easily overcome, when in reality additional challenges may be encountered. On the other hand, adopting a more practical and measured approach, one that does not involve ignoring potential roadblocks or issues, can allow an individual to remain calm and remain focused on their goal.

Having a negative attitude can also be damaging, as it is easy to become overwhelmed and disheartened. 
Having a positive attitude is often touted as a key to success, but is it really the only factor to consider in life? It is true that having an optimistic outlook has a range of benefits – it can make it easier to accomplish goals and build relationships – but there are also times when maintaining a neutral, or even negative, attitude is more relevant.

Going in with an overly-positive mindset can be counterproductive, as it may lead to unrealistic expectations and a frustrating lack of progress. A pessimistic attitude is unlikely to lead to fruitful endeavors, as it can prevent an individual from taking risks or challenging themselves in worthwhile ways. Identifying and creating for yourself a realistic, positive attitude which remains open minded to all possibilities is the best approach for finding success in any endeavour.. Additionally, a pessimistic outlook can also tarnish relationships, making it difficult to form meaningful connections with those around you.

Ultimately, having the right balance between optimism and pessimism is key to finding success in life",1
"As a result, first impressions can shape our future interactions and experiences with them. As a freshman in high school, I was excited to join the basketball team. This is because we tend to use first impressions as benchmarks in forming an opinion about someone or something. 
First impressions can have a lasting impact, and in many instances they are almost impossible to change. 

These experiences have taught me that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Despite our best efforts, those who make an unimpressive first impression often find that subsequent efforts to shake the initial perception are simply not enough. Unbeknownst to me, my teammates had already judged me based on my physical appearance and the fact that I was new to the team. At first, I couldn’t understand why they were so skeptical about me, but then I realized that my reputation was based on a poor first impression. Despite the fact that I worked extremely hard to gain their trust and admiration, I found that it was a losing battle due to my poor first impression. 

To illustrate the effects of first impressions, I’ll use an example from my own life. As a result, first impressions can have a lasting impact and it’s important to make a good one when you meet someone for the first time.. Upon entering the gym for the team’s first practice, I was surprised to find that I already had a negative reputation among some of my teammates",1
"Analyzing criticism can help students to learn and to understand concepts from a different perspective. Notable figures such as Vincent Van Gogh and M.C. In learning, students should be encouraged to challenge their understanding of topics and not be afraid of making mistakes. You cannot learn without taking the risk of making mistakes and potentially receiving criticism, but this should not be seen as a negative thing. It can also be an invaluable source of feedback that can expose them to new ideas and concepts. 

Throughout history, many successful artists have gained perspective and wisdom from the criticism they have received. With this understanding, students can acquire the skills of resilience and problem-solving.

Overall, the role of criticism as a tool of learning is essential, and its importance should be emphasized in the educational field. Escher learnt from constructive criticism on their works despite not seeing the success they eventually did until after their deaths. In the educational field, criticism is just as important as praise when helping students reach their potential.

Receiving criticism is an essential part of building resilience and establishing a growth mindset. By offering students constructive criticism, teachers can create an environment where it is encouraged to ask questions and take risks in learning.

Students should also understand that criticism can be more than just the negative aspect that it is often seen as. While positive reinforcement plays an important role, constructive criticism helps bring a complete educational picture, and in some cases, foster resilience and problem-solving skills in students.",1
"By pulling from his past experiences and continually learning in his new field, Fred was able to achieve his goals and grow into a successful marine ecologist.. He rethought the problem-solving techniques he'd used successfully in the past and applied them to his current situation. He took a course in oceanography and talked to experts who had considerable experience, learning from their successes and failures. His confidence in understanding the subject matter grew, and with it, his success.

The experience taught Fred an important lesson—knowledge and experience are essential to grow and succeed in life. He wanted to accomplish something beyond what he'd already achieved, so he decided to explore a new area of knowledge—the study of marine ecology. He could delve deeper into issues and make innovative connections that offered potential solutions. He scoured libraries and the internet for the latest research.

By continually seeking knowledge in this new field, Fred gained a deeper understanding of the subject. With every challenge, Fred gained not only knowledge, but confidence that he could meet and surpass any goal if he was willing to seek out the right resources. As he dove into the unfamiliar subject, Fred experienced difficult challenges, but it didn't stop him from meeting and surpassing his goals.

Fred quickly realized that in order to succeed, he needed to call on all his past knowledge and experience. 
Fred was a successful business owner, but he wasn't satisfied",1
"While imagination can be important in coming up with creative ideas, knowledge is the essential ingredient in taking action on those ideas. Thus, without knowledge, our dreams will remain just that – dreams. Knowledge can help us to create strategies for navigating the complexity of the world around us, keeping us one step ahead of our competitors and giving us an edge in our respective industries. We need knowledge to make our dreams a reality. Knowledge is thus a fundamental tool for growth and success.

In the end, we can see why knowledge is more important than imagination. Knowledge of the world around us and the various systems at work in society gives us the power to turn creative ideas into tangible plans of action.

The ability to effectively utilize knowledge also gives us the capacity to identify risks and think ahead. Only when combined with knowledge can our ideas become reality.. It is knowledge that allows us to make decisions, solve complex problems and develop plans of action.

Imagination allows us to visualize possibilities and dream up creative solutions to problems, but this is only the first half of success. Imagination is essential to giving us the ideas and visions that can shape our lives, but it is knowledge that gives us the capacity to carry out those ideas. 
Knowledge is often referred to as the key to success, and it’s true – knowledge can open many doors, giving us access to unique opportunities in life",1
"On the other hand, sheer hard work and dedication can help to guide us in the right direction and offer support for our efforts to reach success.. 

Those who argue that success depends on failure cite the fact that failure gives opportunity for growth and insight. 
Success can be a difficult concept to define, and even more difficult to achieve. Without failure, a person may not gain the necessary experience and setback needed to recognize what steps need to be taken in order to succeed. With each failure, we come to understand the shortcomings of our plans and can make improvements to find ultimate success. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.” This exemplifies how failure can aid us on our path to success.

On the other hand, some people believe that success can be obtained without failure, and point to examples of those who found success without making any serious mistakes. They argue that success can be achieved with hard work, dedication, and perhaps a little luck.

In my opinion, true success is a combination of both failure and success. Thomas Edison famously said, “I have not failed. While some argue that it is only through the experience of numerous failures that success can be achieved, others assert that success can be achieved even without the hardships of numerous failures",1
"Ultimately, the benefits of having more leisure time for students should be weighed against the risks of having shorter time to learn.. Educators have varying opinions on whether or not it is beneficial to have longer breaks, and it’s important to look at why people are pushing for more time off. While longer summer and winter breaks might sound appealing, there are pros and cons that must be taken into account. 
As the temperatures drop and winter approaches, it is important to consider the possible risks associated with this season",1
"Churchill’s attitude towards failure and dedication to success played a major role in his achievements and molded him into the successful leader he is known as today.. 
Winston Churchill is often regarded as one of Britain's greatest leaders due to his outstanding contributions during World War II. Churchill was not one to give up in the face of failure, rather he embraced it as an opportunity to learn and strive for greatness. He was known and admired for his courage and resilience, but his impressive success did not come without its struggles. He was quoted saying, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” His unwavering attitude towards failure was a key factor in his successes, as it taught him to face adversity head-on and push past any obstacles he faced in order to reach his desired goals. Besides perseverance, Churchill was known for his dedication and determination; he continually remained focused on the task at hand, no matter the difficulty",1
"
Being successful requires pushing past our comfort levels and continually developing our abilities. Whether that’s through formal education, trying something new or furthering existing skills, the challenge and rewards of going beyond our current abilities will prove to be valuable. With consistent effort, personal growth can become something that becomes a part of who we are. People are capable of so much more than they realize and the only way to affect positive change in our lives is to push beyond our current boundaries.

By taking ownership of our personal growth, rather than waiting for others to provide us with new opportunities, we can actively pursue knowledge and skills. 

Ultimately, to become successful, we need to be devoted to continuously pushing ourselves and pursuing new challenges and opportunities in order to grow and develop. We can learn to be more resilient when faced with difficult obstacles and create stronger bonds with others when we understand the value of self-improvement and pushing the boundaries.

The attitude of refusing to accept our current abilities and continuing to strive for improvement can be applied to all aspects of life, ranging from career achievements and relationships to fitness and mental health. It can be easy to stay within what is familiar to us and just ‘go with the flow’, but that often leaves us stagnant and unable to progress. This can be difficult, but it is necessary in order to evolve and succeed.",1
"However, he started to regret his decision soon after. 

From an educational perspective, John was concerned about the skills he was missing out on. Without that, he felt somewhat unfulfilled and dissatisfied. In a competitive job market, that can be the difference between getting your dream job and struggling to find work. 
My friend, John, thought he was saving himself a lot of time and money by graduating a year early from college. Furthermore, without the additional courses, John was unable to advance his degree to the next level.

In the end, graduating early isn't always the best option. He finished his last semester of classes speedily and was thrilled to be done with school so quickly. 

On a personal level, John felt like he had missed out on the full college experience. Taking classes in that final year would have given him the opportunity to hone his knowledge and acquire new skills. Socializing with his peers and participating in activities were key components of the learning process, giving him the chance to grow as a person. It may seem like a shortcut at first, but the personal and educational drawbacks it brought my friend John showed me just how true that is.",1
"
Distance learning has been rapidly growing in popularity due to its many advantages, such as having classes available from the comfort of one's own home. One potential concern is student motivation and engagement with learning material; without physical contact to the teacher and fellow students, some students may feel less motivated or connected to their studies. Additionally, students can make use of resources such as audio and video recordings to go back and review the material if needed. 

However, distance learning also has some disadvantages. Finally, online classes can also limit students’ access to materials or resources that can only be found in a physical classroom.. It can also be very convenient for students with busy schedules or those who must travel, as learning is no longer affected by physical location. There can be difficulties with the technology and possible miscommunication between students and teachers as well",1
" Personally, I have experienced both failure and success in different situations. To succeed in difficult challenges, it's important to stay positive and prepared. It's not easy to deal with failure, especially when you have high expectations. Taking the initiative to give something a different approach and keeping a positive outlook has certainly helped me better navigate my own experiences with failure and success.. If something isn't working, you can try something different and be open to exploring different opportunities. 

One of the most common aspects of success is learning how to deal with failure. There have been times when I've been close to giving up, only to find that the steps I took to change my perspective ultimately paid off. Despite many successful people having to face failure, they were able to learn from it and turn it into an opportunity for growth. When someone is afraid of failure, the best way to motivate them is to remind them that failure can be a lesson in the journey and that it shouldn't stop them from trying to reach their goals.  Taking a proactive attitude and reframing failure as a learning experience can be a great way to approach any difficult challenge",1
"So when you're ready for a break from the everyday, why not visit your local park and find out what's possible?. 
One of the most enjoyable ways to spend time at a park is bird watching. Seeing different types of birds, from majestic eagles soaring in the sky to feathered warblers chirping in the trees, can provide a relaxing and peaceful experience. Other activities like reading, jogging, and bike riding can fill a day in the park with fun. If you're looking for something more interactive, many parks offer organized sports such as group softball games or fishing derbies. You can also take a picnic to the park, bringing blankets and snacks to sit and enjoy with friends or family",1
"At this age, they typically lack the experience required to make a well-informed decision due to their age and the potential for carelessness. Through this process, students can gain valuable insight into their career options, make an informed decision, and ultimately achieve greater career success.. 
Many students feel pressured to decide on a career by the time they enter high school, but this is not always a good idea. It is essential for students to take the time to explore what interests them, consider their skills and talents, and to try different activities to determine the career that best fits them. 

To make the best decision, students should create a plan, consisting of steps to help them evaluate their options. These steps could include talking with family, guidance counselors, and mentors; considering courses and activities that are related to the field of interest; researching potential job opportunities; and exploring education and specialized training opportunities",1
"

In addition, taking the time to really think about what we want to express and how we want to express it can help us to overcome feelings of shyness and lack of confidence. We may feel embarrassed, scared, or find it difficult to trust ourselves to communicate in the right way. 

In these situations, we can lack confidence in ourselves and in our ability to say or do what we want. These emotions can overwhelm us and prevent us from confidently expressing ourselves.

Fortunately, there are techniques that can help us overcome these fears and anxieties to communicate our emotions with conviction. Expressing emotions is a crucial part of life; it allows us to put into words how we feel and gives us an outlet to build meaningful relationships. However, sometimes expressing these emotions can be difficult, especially when we feel shy about what we are trying to express. It is important to have a supportive group of friends and family who will accept us for who we are, and provide understanding and encouragement as we work to express ourselves. By planning what we want to say, we can go into any situation with the confidence and determination to express ourselves in a meaningful and clear way.

Learning how to express ourselves and our emotions is an essential part of life, but it can be intimidating when we fear rejection or lack confidence in ourselves. With the right level of support and planning, we can confidently express our emotions and our thoughts without being held back by fear and shyness.",1

From the student’s perspective, cell phones provide an invaluable source for learning. Through the use of educational applications and online research resources, cell phones can be used to broaden students’ knowledge and supplement their school education. Furthermore, students can use their cell phones to access other helpful tools such as calculators and translation services which will enable them to better understand and engage with their lessons. Furthermore, allowing students to have access to their cell phones also provides a helpful distraction for those students who have trouble focusing in class. With the various educational resources, stress-reducing capabilities, and contact options provided by cell phones, it is clear that policy one should be implemented in the school system.. 
Cell phones have become an essential part of modern life, and many students rely on them for communication, entertainment, and productivity. Allowing students to have access to their cell phones while at school could be a beneficial policy for both students and teachers alike. This sense of connectedness will likely provide students with a sense of comfort and security and can help to reduce any anxiety or stress levels that they may experience while at school.

From a teacher’s perspective, students having access to their cell phones can provide a number of benefits. For example, when an emergency or urgent situation arises, teachers can easily contact students’ parents or guardians using their cell phones. 

Additionally, giving students access to their cell phones allows them to stay connected with their friends and family. 

In conclusion, allowing students to have access to their cell phones while at school could be a beneficial policy for both students and teachers alike",1

The impact of technology on people's lives is complicated. 

Technology has undeniably changed the way people live today and how they might be living without it. On one hand, technology has allowed people to connect with others in ways never before possible, allowing us to stay in touch with close friends or family members, even if they are far away. Although it can be beneficial to certain aspects of life, it is important to be aware of the negative consequences of technological dependence. Additionally, buying items online has connected people to lucrative deals they otherwise wouldn't have access to and allowed them to make efficient, timely purchases. . 

On the other hand, technology has created a divide between people and their relationships. Moreover, parents often worry about their children spending too much time on their devices and not engaging with the world around them. Technology has become a replacement for physical contact and has made it harder for people to meet and form strong relationships with each other, leading to social isolation",1
"For those who live in a city or state that does not have a statutory curfew, breaking curfew can still result in consequences from the parents such as restricted access to cars and phones, fewer privileges, or grounding. Depending on the severity of the offense, legal penalties can range from fines to jail time. As an alternative to legal penalties, parents can choose to impose other forms of discipline such as discussion, restriction of privileges, or other punishments. If the curfew is established by law, then it is punishable by law. 
The potential consequences of disobeying curfew for teenagers can be severe depending on the city or state where the curfew is being enforced. Ultimately, it is important that parents and teens understand the consequences of breaking curfew and take the necessary steps to ensure it is followed.",1
"Additionally, setting high expectations and holding students to a certain degree of accountability is often useful in helping them commit to their tasks and become stronger. 
    
When it comes to providing effective praise for deficient work, it's important to remember that true self-esteem comes from achievement rather than solely from praises. Keeping the focus on providing constructive feedback and constructive criticisms to the student, rather than simply disciplinary reprimands, can be effective in helping them improve their confidence and build self-esteem.. To promote a student’s self-confidence, it is important to focus not only on what proficiency they have, but also to provide helpful ideas, tips, and reasons on how to improve their proficiency",1
"Working in a group or team provides more opportunities to think critically, develop problem-solving skills, and become aware of different perspectives. While working as a group may not always be the most efficient way to complete a task, the benefits that can be gained from the experience often outweigh the drawbacks.. 
Studies have shown that teamwork can be beneficial for students in a variety of different ways. Collaboration in the classroom can also help to create a more engaging and enjoyable learning experience. In addition, studies have found that working in teams can improve a student's self-esteem and foster a sense of belonging, while reducing feelings of isolation and loneliness. Working with a group can also help students gain a better understanding of the material they are studying, as well as generate new ideas for projects and assignments",1
"For example, having a plan B can assist us in expanding our options and skillsets. However, it can be highly beneficial in both our academic and personal development. 
Taking the opportunity to learn new things might be intimidating at first – it requires us to open ourselves up to the unfamiliar and break away from what we already know. This can be especially useful when we find that certain programs we wish to pursue are no longer available. Being open to trying new activities and topics has allowed me to develop skills and form relationships with people I would not have been able to otherwise. Moving forward, I plan to take any opportunity that arises for me to learn something new and to push myself out of my comfort zone.. 

In my own experience, I have found the opportunity to focus on new topics has enabled me to challenge and broaden my knowledge in a creative way. Additionally, there are opportunities to explore topics we may not initially be interested in but can discover new hobbies and passions",1
"

Online learning has various advantages as well, such as the ability to access educational resources from anywhere with an internet connection, the ability to save money on materials, and the ability to gain insights from multiple perspectives. 
Learning in person provides numerous benefits to students, such as the opportunity to make lasting connections with peers and teachers and understand complex topics more deeply. These include difficulty connecting with classmates and instructors, lack of hands-on activities, and less personalized instruction.. 

While there are many advantages to online learning, it does come with some challenges. Attending school also provides students with valuable life experiences that they can draw from for years to come",1
"

By studying the experiences of someone with multiple careers, it is possible to take away valuable information on how they managed to move between each different career and succeed. Additionally, failure can be seen as a learning opportunity, where we can take something away from the experience, while gaining the confidence to attempt such endeavours again. Exploring and learning new activities can also help increase our knowledge and grow our skill sets. In addition to research, a practical way to gain the necessary skills is to try a recipe or activity that you have never done before and practice it to perfect your skills. This knowledge can then be used to develop and form our own career plan. 
For those looking to be successful in multiple careers, research is essential. Nevertheless, it is essential to remember the importance of research and the willingness to experience something new in order to be successful in multiple careers.. 

Experimenting with new things can often increase our self-confidence because we gain a sense of accomplishment in learning something new. It takes a lot of effort to learn the skills needed and stay on top of ever-changing trends within each industry",1
"From Thomas Jefferson's famous maxim that encouraged citizens to ""never put off until tomorrow that which you can do today,"" an active and industrious spirit has been fundamental to our success. 
Throughout American history, the push for active thought and behavior has been a key factor in our nation's progress. From everyday people to entire nations, an idle lifestyle can often lead to stagnation, which often leads to missed opportunities and, in some cases, a complete reversal of fortune.

In order to avoid a similar fate and ensure a prosperous future, active behavior must remain at the forefront of our minds. We can use our devices to make our lives easier and put off taking action until tomorrow, or even until next week.  So let us take his words as a reminder to stay active and seize the day so that we can create a better future and leave behind a lasting legacy.. Taking Thomas Jefferson’s words to heart, we must not be afraid to invest our time and energy into something today rather than waiting until tomorrow. However, the flip side of this mentality has been the risk of becoming too passive and idle in our society. Such a mindset will not only help us reach our individual goals more efficiently but will also benefit the country as a whole. But if history has taught us anything, it's that idle behavior comes with a price. Unfortunately, this has had dire consequences more than once, leading to tragic consequences and lost opportunities.

Today, technology has made it easier than ever to live an idle lifestyle",1
"His playing career is considered an example of determination and resolve in the face of failure.

The space program has faced a number of failed attempts at launching spaceships over the years. During his career, Pele won several World Cups and scored over 1,000 goals. This idea serves as a reminder that failure can be an important step on the path to ultimate success.. Whether it’s a lack of fuel, a key component malfunction, or other issues, failed space launches have been a part of the exploration of space since its inception.

Arguments against the idea of failure being related to success are varied. Some believe failure to be synonymous with personal or career stagnation, while others view failure as a necessary learning experience. Additionally, the international body had no armed forces of its own to ensure cooperation, making it unable to keep a handle on the international system in the decades leading up to WWII.

Meanwhile, famed soccer player Pele is one of the most celebrated sportspeople of all time, with competitive success being perhaps his greatest accomplishment. Without the United States’ support, it lacked the necessary power to enforce collective security. Whatever one’s opinion may be, it is clear failure can have both a positive and negative impact on one’s overall success.

Winston Churchill famously said, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” Churchill’s words reflect the critical role of both failures and enthusiasm when it comes to achieving success. He underscores the importance of perseverance and the risk of giving up because of fear of failure. 

The League of Nations, one of the predecessors of the United Nations, was considered a failure for a variety of reasons",1
"However, it is important to recognize the danger of overreliance and remember that technology is a resource and a tool — one that should be used intelligently and with consideration for its consequences.. It is important to learn how to properly utilize technology and its features so that human contact and communication are not lost. Face-to-face conversations are becoming more scarce, and the consequences of this could be severe. Furthermore, technology has enabled us to connect with people from around the world, allowing us to communicate with near-instantaneous speed. It enables us to communicate across long distances in mere seconds and has made the world feel ever-so-slightly smaller. With more communication and information readily available, the value of human contact can be lessened. People who are physically limited by their lack of mobility, speech, or hearing can now access communication, information, and services without the limitations of a physical world. 

Although technology has brought about great strides in our lives, it is important to consider the downsides of this progression. 
Technology has become an integral part of modern living, and it is difficult to ignore the multitude of ways it has improved our lives. Online shopping, for instance, provides an immense convenience that wasn’t available before; buying a book without leaving your house is now a reality. 

Ultimately, there is little argument against the fact that technology has had an overwhelmingly positive effect on both our personal and professional lives",1
"Working with others also increases motivation and allows the group to find a collective strategy and direction. The advantages of working in a team include getting varied perspectives, diverse voices, and multiple inputs that broaden the scope and depth of the assignment. By combining the knowledge, skills, and creativity of each member of the team, it is easier to create a better quality product and have more collaborative success than if working alone. 
Working with a group on an assignment can be extremely beneficial, particularly when it comes to leveraging the strengths of each group member. To conclude, working in a group is essential to producing successful outcomes for a project, and it also provides team members with essential skills for future projects.. The group leader plays an important role in any group, setting the goals and guiding the team in order to maximize their collective potential",1

The topic of changing the school lunch menu is highly important, and carries with it a variety of advantages for students. Finally, students who may not be receiving enough nutrients or variety at home could receive the necessary vitamins and minerals that their bodies need for growth.

The advantages of changing the school lunch menu are extensive. For one, students who are typically unwell or have physical illnesses could greatly benefit from a menu that provides healthier and more nutritious meals. Additionally, those who participate in school sports could benefit from a menu that is specifically tailored to ensure they are receiving the necessary vitamins and minerals that will help with hydration, energy, and muscle repair. It could also provide students who are unwell with healthier and nutritious meals, give students participating in school sports the nutritional requirements for their sport, and provide those who may be going hungry with a balanced and nutritious diet. Ultimately, this change could ensure that students get the sustenance they need to thrive.. This change could improve the health of students and contribute to overall well-being",1
"College also provides access to a wide range of potential internships and networking opportunities that can help a student to pursue a career in their chosen field and grow their career as a professional. It allows for an expansive education and access to a wealth of resources that can help students as they progress in their studies and into the workplace.. The accelerated program allows students to start university earlier and to graduate college in four short years, instead of the traditional five. It provides an opportunity to fast track courses, save money on tuition, and to be professionally successful. Such a program can foster a student's intellectual curiosity and further a high-level of learning. 
Graduating high school after only three years instead of the traditional four can be beneficial in many ways. From a financial perspective, graduating high school in three years will save the family money in the long run. This means earlier access to post-graduate studies and potential career opportunities. With the accelerated program, students are able to take advanced courses and are provided with an opportunity to be ahead in college-level coursework. 

In the end, graduating high school in three years provides the groundwork for a successful college and career journey afterwards. College offers a valuable education, along with the opportunity to develop interpersonal skills, hone critical thinking and problem solving abilities, and grow academically and socially. 

Overall, graduating high school early and pursuing a college degree afterwards is a beneficial career path",1
"Also, starting out a career at a young age can provide a foundation for future success. It is important for teenagers to take the time to explore their individual goals and get the most out of their high school experience before taking on the responsibility of a job.. However, there are also some potential drawbacks to starting work at a young age. Instead, young people should seek to find balance between pursuing their interests and furthering their education in order to be prepared for their eventual career. 

Overall, I believe it is not always necessary for students to start a career as teenagers. For example, young people are often full of energy and enthusiasm, and they can take on tasks with a great deal of vigor and determination. For instance, young people may lack the experience and critical thinking skills that come with age, making it difficult for them to effectively plan ahead and make connections. In addition, adolescents can often be easily taken advantage of by those with more experience in the workforce, making it difficult for them to make the best career decisions for themselves. 
It is true that there are some advantages to pursuing a career at a young age",1

As I approached the doctor's clinic, I could feel the buzz of activity. 

At one point, I received an invitation to observe a real-life operation. As I watched, I took detailed notes about the doctor's work environment, the materials used, and the decisions they faced. I watched as the doctor and staff members interacted, discussing the decisions that had to be made and the treatments that needed to be done.

When it was time for my appointment, the doctor welcomed me warmly into the office. I asked questions about the tools they used and the situations they faced on a daily basis, and they provided me with insightful advice for pursuing a career in medicine. Inside, a team of doctors, nurses, and support staff worked in a flurry, gathering supplies and monitoring patient charts. In the operating theater, I witnessed the doctor and nurses in action, and I was struck by their confidence and skill as they operated on the patient. We spoke at length about their experiences in the medical field, and they shared with me some of the challenges and rewards of their job. 

The experience at the doctor's clinic was eye-opening, and I feel more equipped now to pursue my career aspirations in medicine.",1

Taking classes online offers students many advantages as opposed to attending physical classes in school. Therefore, it is fair to conclude that online classes have clear advantages that benefit students in their learning process.. Students who take online classes can also work at their own pace, since they are not limited to prescribed class times. Furthermore, classes are available on their own schedule and assignments can even be due after midnight, meaning snow days and other external factors that would otherwise cause school closure have no effect. For students who are not fond of attending class in person, online classes provide the benefit of being able to learn from the comfort of their own homes. Taking classes online provides students with a convenient option to work with their own schedule and complete work in a more comfortable environment",1
"On the other hand, this collaboration requires communication, trust, and a lot of effort to ensure that both parties come away with a positive outcome. For example, schools with strong business partnerships may have access to new technologies, mentors, and community resources. Additionally, these partnerships can open doors for students, offering internships and job prospects, while helping the community grow in the process. 
When it comes to schools having local partnerships, there are various risks and rewards involved. They can also provide students with a better understanding of the industry and potential career paths they can explore. This can help students stay engaged in their studies and equip them with the skills they need to succeed. On the other hand, benefits of collaboration can include access to mentors and resources, project-based learning opportunities, and more diverse classroom learning experiences. 

Through careful consideration and thoughtful partnerships, schools have the potential to become a much needed source of hope and opportunity for students. 

Successful businesses with local partnerships often create positive, lasting changes within their communities. By exploring these implications and establishing strategies that help students succeed, schools can create an environment that helps young adults to reach their highest potential.. The risks and rewards of having a partnership with a local company should be carefully weighed out in order to maximize the benefits for students. 

Challenges that come with forming partnerships can range from not understanding the company's values and goals, to different levels of commitment between schools and businesses. On one hand, schools can benefit from the expertise and resources that companies bring to the table",1
"To go against expectations and pursue the path you really want to be on is a brave choice to make, but it is also necessary for a fulfilling life. Making decisions that respect authority can be an integral part of success, in many areas of life, and following the rules may provide a much-needed structure or sense of security. 
Being yourself may not always be the most natural or easy approach in life, and many of us go out of our way to try and be someone we are not in order to fit in or make others happy. After all, it takes courage and an independent mindset to make decisions for yourself and go against the grain of what is expected.

Take for example the classic story of a person from a conservative family, who may be expected to pursue a certain career or study specific subjects, but harbors a passion for something completely different. Ultimately though, at the end of the day, having the power to make our own decisions, for that one person who grew up in a conservative family, is a testament to a successful life journey.. Being flexible and adaptable to new opportunities and experiences can open up our lives to unimaginable possibilities that could not have been forecasted. However, embracing the idea of not being yourself and departing from expectations and obligations can often be an accomplishment. There are always consequences, both positive and negative, to following or not following rules. 

One thing to remember is that while it is important to be yourself and be independent, it is equally important to still be mindful of rules and regulations",1
"This helps reduce stress levels for students, enabling them to focus on the quality of their work and curate something unique and insightful. 
Famously competitive rivals, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi both agree that allowing students to design their own summer projects can be immensely beneficial for their overall academic growth and development. Ultimately, students can benefit from designing their own projects, as it encourages them to be proactive in their learning journey, challenge their own limits, and embrace the creative freedom available to them.. Real-life examples show that students have sometimes struggled to adhere to the expectations of their teachers when completing summer projects, which reflects how allowing students to design their own projects can be less stressful for them and more enjoyable too. While Ronaldo emphasizes that it encourages creativity and the joy of learning through an independent approach, Messi points out that it provides an opportunity for students to develop a sense of ownership and autonomy over their work",1
"I'm determined to work hard and make this dream a reality. 
I've set an ambitious goal for myself: playing on a professional soccer team, such as Barcelona, and representing my country in international matches. My focus now is on training and developing myself to become the best player I can be.. I'm researching the best ways to improve my strength and agility so I can become a reliable and successful player. I'm striving to be the player who will bring joy and success to my country by winning the World Cup",1
"Developing the ability to think independently and trust one's own judgement can provide greater control over one's life. Ultimately, it is a matter of personal preference and the individual's individual needs should be taken into consideration to decide the most beneficial option. This external help can help to develop skills and provide valuable guidance. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages and the decision should take into account the implications for personal growth and development.. 
Self-sufficiency is a key component of personal growth and development, allowing one to make their own decisions and be more responsible for their actions. Making one's own decisions can lead to a greater sense of independence but relying on external help can be just as beneficial in certain circumstances. However, seeking guidance from experts can be beneficial for understanding complex situations as it can provide helpful advice and support",1
"Setting higher level goals can require extra focus, time, energy, and other resources that may have a financial or emotional consequence. In this way, one can find growth in all aspects and gain knowledge that will remain with them for a lifetime. 

To begin, setting goals to a higher level forces an individual to challenge themselves and grow in order to reach that end goal. Goals provide clarity, set expectations and can help keep someone on track and focused on their end goal. 

However, it is important to note that this type of growth comes with a certain cost. Furthermore, challenging goals can provide someone with a variety of intellectual, physical, and emotional experiences that will be beneficial in the long run. Moreover, if the goal is too far out of reach, it can lead to a sense of failure and an unwillingness to keep striving towards the goal.

Overall, setting goals to a higher level provides one with more growth and a greater sense of success compared to setting goals at a lower level. Doing so can help one reach to the top without sacrificing too much and experiencing the most benefit.. When setting goals to a higher level, there are clear benefits that can be seen compared to setting goals to a low level. On the other hand, it is important to keep a sense of balance when setting goals as to not end up overwhelmed or taken aback if the goal is out of reach. Growth in terms of experiences, awareness, and knowedge. 
For many people who want to achieve something significant in life, setting goals is a crucial step in the effort of reaching that success. Reaching higher level objectives can also open up the possibility to more, as putting extra effort into a task or achieving a goal that seems extreme can open up myriad of other opportunities that one may not have had access to before. Achieving more difficult goals can not only provide a sense of success and pride, but also can give validation to progress made and a sense of growth. When setting these objectives, it is important to consider the level of difficulty and the expected growth one will experience",1

Finding out who I am and what my purpose in life is is not an easy task. Society often puts pressure on us to follow a certain path and being true to ourselves can be challenging amidst it all.

I want to remain dedicated to my own sense of identity and not be swayed by the opinions of others. I will prioritize my own needs, carve out time for things I'm passionate about, and allow myself to explore potential interests. By being actively conscious and true to myself, I can discover who I am and what I am meant to do.. To stay true to myself, I will strive to take time to reflect and be mindful of my own thoughts and feelings. Many people rely on family and friends for guidance but it can be difficult to really listen to your own inner voice",1
"Independence also plays a role in becoming self-reliant. 

In conclusion, self-reliance is a necessary trait for leading a productive life but it should be balanced with taking constructive advice from others. Experience matters as well, since having prior knowledge and learning from mistakes helps one make sound judgements and take meaningful actions. It is important to be able to make decisions for yourself and not always have to rely on somebody else’s opinion. Taking advice from someone who is more experienced in a field and learning from them can be beneficial and even highlight areas where one was ignorant. Therefore, it is important to assess each situation and use wisdom in order to find the right amount of self-reliance to suit one’s needs.. It involves having the common sense to solve a problem without expecting someone else to take the lead and responsibility. 
  Self-reliance is an important attribute to possess in order to be successful and lead a happy, fulfilling life. For instances, it can lead to a lack of collaboration in which people become too isolated and don't learn from the ideas of others. 

However, there is an argument against relying too much on oneself",1
"Additionally, they will have more time to connect more often as a family.

By adopting a four-day school week model, students, their families, and the environment can yield benefits. They can save money on transportation to and from school and on extracurricular activities, as well as less food waste produced from lunches. This can also have a significant impact on the environment and can help cut down on energy and resource consumption.

If applied to the education system, adopting a four-day school week model can likewise bring advantages to students, their families, and the environment. For example, students can have more flexibility in their schedules, allowing them to spend additional time on outside activities, such as music lessons, sports, hobby clubs, and community work. By reducing the number of days worked each week to four, employees have more days off, leading to lower stress levels, increased motivation and fresh energy for the days worked. They can also use their three-day weekend to rest and recharge for the next week, reducing their stress levels and anxiety about homework and tests. It will help create a healthier, more successful environment for those involved while helping reduce stress, energy consumption, and resource waste.. By closing the school for one day each week, energy costs go down, as well as the amount of paper, resources, and waste produced.

Families can also benefit from a four-day school week model, by having more days of freedom to get out and explore. 
    More and more businesses are beginning to embrace the idea of a four-day workweek. Furthermore, the four-day school week model helps reduce energy and resource consumption",1
"For example, research has shown that taking an elective course in business can lead to better outcomes for students in finance-related careers. 
When it comes to electives, the debate is divided between those who see them as a vital part of academic and personal growth, and those who view them as a mere distraction from the pursuit of knowledge. On the other hand, some students find the range of elective offerings to be too limited or uninteresting, leading them to question why they even need to attend school at all. Ultimately, it is incumbent upon educators to offer elective classes that are interesting and relevant to students, in order to ensure that every student has the opportunity to explore the subjects that interest them the most.. Additionally, taking an elective can help students to improve their academic performance by increasing their engagement with the material. On one hand, electives expose students to a variety of subjects, allowing them to gain valuable skills and knowledge outside of their chosen major. Additionally, students can use electives to explore their interests, helping them to determine their future career path. 

To evaluate the impact of elective classes, one must consider the academic and career opportunities available to students",1
"A positive attitude can show employers and colleagues the state of our mental health and resilience towards challenges, making it easier for us to take the steps towards a brighter future.. For example, a study from the University of Michigan showed that students with a positive attitude about taking a tough math course achieved better results than students with negative attitudes, regardless of their level of intelligence or King’s College London tested the effect of “positive thinking” on athletes and found that successfully imagining the act of completing a task can increase motivation.

In our professional and personal lives, having a positive attitude can open the doors of opportunity. With resilience and conviction, any individual can develop the necessary skills and knowledge to become successful, but it is the attitude that makes them shine. You have to catch it yourself.” 

What makes a positive attitude the key to success is its role in personal motivation. It is no wonder that so many prominent figures throughout history have highlighted the importance of developing a positive outlook—including Benjamin Franklin, who famously said, “The Constitution only guarantees the American people the right to pursue happiness. 

Positive attitude is undoubtedly a key to success. This is because positive thinking leads to optimism, which can improve quality of work, thus making us more appealing to employers or allowing us to achieve our goals. 
Attitude is often described as “the lens through which we view the world.” Indeed, having a positive attitude can significantly improve our daily lives, from the way we approach the workplace to the way we handle relationships",1

Being yourself means embracing the qualities that make you the individual that you are. 

On the one hand, a person may be able to reinvent themselves for the better, freeing themselves of the trappings of the past and emerging anew, unburdened by whatever shackles them. Furthermore, it can be difficult to return to the person they once were due to societal pressures, fear of what others may think, or simply a lack of the same spirit that led them to make the change in the first place. Throughout history, there have been many examples of people seeking to be someone they are not. It challenges the very cohesive idea of an unchanging “original you” as one may have different personalities in different settings, contexts, or times in life.. But on the other, they may be forced to change themselves in undesirable ways, potentially becoming cowardly in their attempt to fit in with their new environment. It is the process of being confident in who you are and living your life honestly and authentically. 

Overall, changing who you are involves taking a risk and reflects how someone adapts to their dynamic environment. Whether it be to hide their true identities from an oppressive government, to fit in with a different social circle, or to simply chase a different version of themselves, this kind of transformation can have both positive and negative effects",1

Adults have an important opportunity to provide affirmation to younger individuals to support and build self-esteem. It also shows that there are people around who believe in them and trust their potential. Through providing these positive affirmations, adults have the privilege of creating an encouraging atmosphere, a sense of security, and a safe environment to learn and grow.. Studies have shown that we are more likely to reach goals and feel secure when we receive positive affirmations from those around us. 
Self-esteem is the foundation for feelings of self-worth and courage, and can be cultivated from positive affirmations provided by others. Trust in oneself and others can also help to build self-esteem, bolstering confidence and resilience. 

To illustrate, an individual who may have previously felt lack of faith in their ability to complete a task, may receive praise from an adult for their progress thus far. This well-intentioned encouragement can be a large motivator for the individual, as it helps make them feel capable and affirmed in their mission",1

Additionally, having more breaks gives me an opportunity to do fun activities like exploring new cities or trying new outdoor hobbies. We were able to get to destinations and explore sites which we would not have been able to with a two-week summer break. This, I believe, is an invaluable experience which is made possible through the extra time schools may provide students with by granting them extended breaks.. 

Longer breaks provide students with the opportunity to connect and spend time with family and friends. These experiences provide much needed time away from the rigors of school and studying. 

By providing students with extended breaks from schools, we are giving them the opportunity to enrich their lives outside school by visiting interesting places, trying new activities, and spending time with friends and family. 
As a student, I can personally vouch for the fact that frequent, extended breaks from school would be beneficial. During breaks, I have the time to hang out with my family and also travel. From experience, I can attest that having a longer summer break, a longer winter break, and a one-week break in the spring and fall would unduely help students in multiple ways. Last summer, I was able to take a road trip with a few friends with the additional time provided",1
"When we open up to other people about our personal successes and struggles, it can help us form meaningful relationships, which can be a source of support and inspiration.

However, although learning from others can help greatly, ultimate success still largely depends on hard work and dedication. 
One of the greatest benefits of learning from the experiences of others is that it can provide a shortcut to success. Seeing the success of someone else may motivate us to strive for our own, but to actually achieve our goals, it is necessary to put in the necessary effort. Thus, it is important to recognize the importance of our own hard work and never give up.. This kind of wisdom can be shared and can promote personal growth and help us achieve our goals.

Shared experiences can also create connections and solidarity. By examining the successes and struggles of those that came before us, we can gain invaluable insight into how to approach and overcome the common challenges of success",1

Ultimately, being organized and motivated can offer many benefits, from improved productivity to increased confidence in achieving success.. Focusing on the end result and breaking tasks into small steps are proven strategies to stay motivated. Staying organized and responsible can vastly increase efficiency, allowing you to reach those goals faster and with less stress. In today's fast-paced world, it is especially important to not procrastinate and stay on top of goals and tasks.

My aunt has always been a crucial part of my life. I often reflect on her words of advice; particularly when I am in the process of making a decision. She told me to just take things one step at a time and to remember that the choices I make do not have to be permanent. With her sage advice, she taught me that mistakes give you the opportunity to grow and to learn.

One of the most vivid examples of her advice was when I started to become overwhelmed with all of the opportunities in front of me when studying for college. Her support has helped me find my own inner strength, as I have come to the realization that it is alright to make mistakes. She reminded me to never give up and to keep pushing through, even when faced with uncertainty.

The wisdom my aunt has shared with me has been integral in how I live my life. From an early age, her words of wisdom and years of experience have shaped the way I look at the world and how I make decisions. Ultimately, her guidance has been invaluable to my formation as an individual, and I am grateful for all of the life lessons she has given me.. Growing up, she was the first to tell me never to give up and to remember that it is ok to make mistakes",1
"Goals allow us to focus on specific areas of our lives we wish to improve and provide us with a roadmap for reaching those goals. Despite the temptations of lying and cheating to reach our objectives, the long-term ramifications can be too costly for most people. Lying and cheating can be very tempting, but the repercussions are often much greater than the short-term benefits. 
Setting goals and working hard to achieve them is one of the most effective strategies for success. A better strategy is to use our skills, time, and resources to create a plan that will sustain our success over the long term.. Many often forget that breaking the rules and pursuing their goals dishonestly can lead to serious consequences that include severe financial penalties, loss of reputation, and even incarceration.

In the end, it's important to remember that setting goals and working hard to achieve them is the most productive and reliable way to succeed. By setting realistic goals and taking steps to reach them, we can move closer to our important pursuits.

In another example, the popular country music artist Taylor Swift found her success by writing honest songs that people could relate to. Their passion turned into ambition, which allowed them to eventually revolutionize how the world views technology today. 

For example, consider Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, two of the most famous entrepreneurs of all-time. It is often said that the phrase ""be yourself"" has become cliché, but in short, it is incredibly powerful. 
Everyone has unique passions, skills, and dreams, which can be difficult to pursue if you are not truly being yourself",1
"Accomplishing a goal gives an individual a renewed sense of self-confidence and a feeling of self-efficacy they can use to tackle the next goal. For instance, athletes demonstrate improved self-concept after successfully completing a challenging physical task, such as running a race or performing a difficult routine in a gymnastics event. 
Reaching goals helps to build an individual's self-esteem in many ways. This increase in self-confidence pushes them to persist in their efforts to reach the goals they have set for themselves. Furthermore, reaching a goal gives an individual a sense of accomplishment and self-praise that can last long after the goal has been achieved.

Recent studies have shown that when people make progress towards a goal, their self-esteem increases. Additionally, students who make progress in their academic endeavors often report higher levels of self-esteem. When students improve their grades, their self-concept tends to improve as well.

Overall, the evidence confirms that achieving goals helps enhance an individual's self-esteem in multiple ways. Accomplishment of a goal not only provides an individual with long-lasting satisfaction but also pushes them to continue striving for greatness. With little effort, these positive behaviors can help individuals feel more empowered and confident in their endeavors.",1
"We are constantly bombarded with messages and information from society and the media telling us what we should and shouldn't do. You will also be more confident in your decisions, and have the courage to pursue your dreams.

At the end of the day, the most important thing is for you to stay true to yourself and do what makes you happy. You are unique – no one else shares the same character traits, life experiences, and views as you. By being yourself, you will have a greater sense of purpose and direction in your life. As a result, many of us fall into the trap of trying to conform to expectations in order to fit in and be accepted. 

But it is important to remember that being true to yourself is essential for a happy and healthy life. There are no right or wrong answers in life, and you should not live your life according to anyone else's expectations. By being yourself, you will be able to create a life worth living.. It is your differences that make you unique and special.

When you are comfortable in your own skin, you will also be more likely to take on challenging tasks, explore new opportunities, and communicate your needs and wants with others in an effective way. 
In today's world, it's easy to forget the importance of simply being yourself",1
"For example, in places where curfews are strictly enforced, it can have a negative effect on the teen’s safety by causing them to flee from or avoid law enforcement during an emergency. When curfews are enforced properly and in moderation, they can be effective in promoting safety and instilling good habits and values in teens. In addition, it can over-restrict teens, hampering their ability to develop healthy time management skills and even negatively impact their academic performance.

Ultimately, it is up to parents and guardians to assess whether curfews are appropriate for their teens and how they should be implemented. 

When it comes to the issue of curfews for teenagers, opinions widely vary. 

Critics of curfews argue that these rules may be counter-productive in some cases. Advocates for strict curfews indicate that this practice has potential benefits like reducing teen delinquency and crime, reducing the risks of young people falling victim to drugs and alcohol, and creating a sense of order and structure in a youth’s life. Ultimately, curfews are just one of many tools available to parents and guardians to ensure their teens’ safety, wellbeing, and success.. Generally, a curfew is imposed for the purpose of protecting teens by limiting the amount of time they can be out of parental or adult supervision",1
"Ciber bullying is a major issue of modern times which can have major consequences, such as decreased self-esteem, a heightened risk of depression, and in some extreme cases, suicide. Risks associated with ordering food online include potential health hazards due to mishandling of the food and even theft of personal information. Despite these unavoidable risks associated with technology, mobile devices and software updates can be used to positively influence people's lives, particularly through coordinated communication with family and friends, both domestically and abroad. 
The modern world is becoming increasingly technology focused, especially in regards to communication and interactions. Research has shown that increased time on sedentary electronic activities has been linked to lower levels of physical activity, higher risk of anxiety and depression, and decreased social capability. This rise in technology and use of digital tools has had significant effects on physical activity, mental health and social interactions for both children and adults. However, using a mobile device to communicate abroad can introduce risks of large financial complications due to high international rates.",1
"When we experience a setback, we can focus on what we have learned and use it to redirect ourselves to our goals. Knowing what doesn’t work makes it easier to pinpoint what does. 
Failure is a fundamental part of the human experience. 

Failure can provide a wealth of knowledge. As Winston Churchill said: “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” This courage helps us continue to foster and grow our strengths, acknowledge and shift our weaknesses, and ultimately become successful.. By acknowledging failure and learning from its mistakes, we can develop the courage and fortitude to continue striving for success. This process of trial and error can lead to discovering new and innovative solutions to problems and achieving success. As Winston Churchill put it: “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” In other words, failure is what helps us move forward and ultimately become successful. We can also become more resilient by addressing our mistakes head-on and developing new skills and strategies for the future. 

Failures can also provide direction to our interests and goals. 

Failure should not be feared but instead embraced. If we look closely at our failures, we can see what went wrong, anticipate potential obstacles in future projects, and take steps to correct them. As we continue our journey, we more easily recognize patterns of success and apply them to other areas of our lives. It’s through failure that we learn, grow, and ultimately succeed. With each mistake or loss comes a valuable lesson",1
"
The famous words of Thomas Jefferson that ""we must not let our passions destroy our reason"" emphasize the importance of self-discipline and taking action in order to achieve goals and make a positive difference in the lives of others. When we take these actions, it can inspire others to join us in these efforts, and encourage them to take on projects that they care about and make the world a brighter place. There are various avenues one can take to help those in need - donating money or supplies, volunteering time and energy, educating oneself on the issues, and participating in advocacy. These efforts not only make a lasting beneficial impact on those being helped, but they can also empower us to realize our own potential and lead to personal growth. Doing good for those around us is truly essential, and is a necessary step towards becoming the best version of ourselves.",1
"Being yourself allows you to have a sense of confidence and comfort in yourself, and makes it easier to express and share your ideas with others. We all need to be reminded from time to time why it is so important to be ourselves and to realize the greatness that exists within all of us. 

Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, “To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.” As I’ve grown older, I’ve come to appreciate and understand the essence of his wise words. Accepting ourselves and who we are is one of the most important steps we can take in life. Despite the challenges that may come our way, by being true to ourselves, we can find true happiness.. 

Overall, Emerson’s words are as relevant today as ever. It helps us develop and become better people by allowing us to gain knowledge and experiences in life. 

We often face pressure to conform or fit into certain social roles or expectations, and, while it may be easier to simply comply with the status quo, there is nothing quite like finding the courage and inner peace that comes from being yourself, regardless of what society thinks",1
"Online classes can also provide students with a focused environment to learn, without having to worry about the hustle and bustle of a traditional campus setting.. 
The advantages of taking classes online or via video conferencing are a great option for students who cannot pay for college, as well as those who had previously been unable to go to college due to financial reasons. Online classes can give students who are working and going to school at the same time the flexibility they need to manage their time and responsibilities.  Additionally, with the growing issue of limited parking space on college campuses, online classes can alleviate a large amount of stress on students as commuting is no longer a requirement for attending class",1
"
Failure is an essential part of the learning process as it helps us grow more resilient and empowered. Unfortunately, I failed to get the desired score in one test and felt like I let myself down. It is important to remain positive and motivated when life throws us challenges and to use experiences of failure as learning opportunities to make us better and closer to achieving our goals. I was determined to prove that I could do better and eventually I surpassed all expectations and graduated at the top of my class. 

Whatever challenges we face in life, there’s always valuable lessons to be learnt from our mistakes or failures. This painful experience pushed me to work harder and turn my disappointment into motivation. 

For example, when I was in school, I put a lot of pressure on myself to get the best grades possible and be the valedictorian of my class. This experience taught me to stay positive and use failures as a motivation to persevere. Instead of feeling discouraged and giving up, embracing these challenges and failure-driven learning experiences can help one to reach their goals and elevate their personal growth.",1
"On one hand, it can provide a strong support system of guidance and perspective, but on the other hand, it can create an environment of constraints and ‘shoulds’.

For example, Caitlyn decided to become independent by pursuing a career in web development. Ultimately, the decision of whether to be independent or depend on someone else should be made mindfully, and not due to external pressures or expectations.. On the other hand, Mary was encouraged by her family to pursue a degree in Biology, but not for her own enjoyment or interests. Independent individuals have the freedom to make decisions which will directly affect the life they are leading, without any external pressure from other people or society. People who become independent by being themselves reflect their own authentic values and beliefs in their decisions, allowing them to become more confident and in control of their destiny.

The advantages of being true to yourself and remaining independent in this way can be seen in areas such as career decisions, financial decisions, and relationships. 
Being independent is a way for people to be unshackled from the expectations and opinions of other people and step out from the shadows of society. Here, the lack of independence meant that Mary felt pressured to make a decision which wasn’t right for her, consequently leading to her dropping out of school.

In conclusion, becoming independent by being yourself can have a positive impact on personal decisions, bringing about more confidence and allowing you to make better choices which reflect your own values and beliefs. However, depending on someone else can also provide guidance and support if used correctly. In doing so, she was able to explore her talent for coding, as well as her passion, while feeling in control of her own future. Likewise, depending on someone else can have both positive and negative repercussions. Being yourself is a way for people to think for themselves and make their own decisions, free from outside influences",1
"Overall, my experience living in Generic_City has been a positive one.. 

As an immigrant, I am able to relate to the difficult journey of leaving one’s home in pursuit of a better life. The city boasts a strong job market, competitive educational institutions, and a supportive government leadership. Despite these unique differences, visitors can often find similar recreational activities that bring together old and new cultures alike. 
Generic_City is a rapidly changing destination that offers a variety of socioeconomic opportunities for immigrants from all walks of life. Everyday resources and services are welcome additions that often make it easier for citizens and immigrants to manage daily needs and activities. 

The culture and society in Generic_City differ from those of United States in several ways; language barriers, economic developments, and school systems are all examples of distinguishing characteristics. The experiences of being an immigrant can be both challenging and rewarding; I have encountered both opportunities and obstacles, but ultimately am grateful for the growth and progress",1

"Thomas Jefferson's famous statement ""determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing,"" underlines this point. Through personal experience I have come to understand the transformative impact that resisting idleness can have on our lives. Additionally, I have found that this lifestyle has enabled me to have a more positive attitude and greater resilience in the face of adversity. 
Excerpt: 
Physical exercise has often been touted as one of the best methods for improving overall health and wellbeing. By maintaining an active lifestyle, I have experienced improved physical health, strengthened relationships, and greater self-development. Therefore, it is evident that physical exercise and not being idle can result in significant improvements to health, relationships, self-development, and overall outlook on life.",1
"By pressing on even in the face of failure, we gain insight into what works and what doesn't, enabling us to arrive at successes that may not have been achievable had we given up in the face of adversity.

Enthusiasm is also essential to the pursuit of success. This quote captures the truth that failure and enthusiasm are both integral parts of the pursuit of success. Winston Churchill's quote is a reminder of this important truth, and should inspire us to face obstacles with courage, and to stay committed to our ambitions with enthusiasm.. We must learn to embrace failure as part of the journey and to keep our enthusiasm alive despite challenges and setbacks. We must remember, however, that failure is often part of the journey in the pursuit of success. Life is filled with challenges and difficult moments, and the courage to face them and the enthusiasm to drive towards our ambitions helps us to reach our goals.

Failure can often be an unpleasant experience, and it can be difficult to keep our enthusiasm when failure happens. 
Winston Churchill famously said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts"". If we possess an unshakeable enthusiasm, we can stay focused on our goals and make significant strides in achieving them.

Both failure and enthusiasm are essential part of a successful life. It helps to keep us motivated and inspired, and when coupled with courage, it can be a powerful tool in overcoming the challenges we inevitably encounter on our journeys. Failure teaches us valuable lessons that can help us to become better equipped to reach our goals",1
"While it's true that having an optimistic outlook can lay a foundation for success, it needs to be balanced with tangible action towards the goal. It is this combination that can bring about the most desirable outcome, and should be the foundation of anyone's approach to life.. I know this to be true because I have seen it firsthand in my own life and the lives of those around me. He's accomplished more in his short time on earth than I ever thought possible given the circumstances he has faced, and I believe this is directly attributable to his unshakeable optimism.

Others may argue that having a positive attitude is not necessarily a guarantee of success. 

For example, one of my best friends always approaches life with a can-do attitude, no matter the situation. It's often said that the most successful individuals are those who have a ""never quit"" attitude, believing that anything can be achieved with hard work and dedication. 
When it comes to succeeding in life, having a positive attitude is an essential ingredient. Additionally, there are numerous external factors, from economic systems to socio-cultural contexts, that shape success or failure.

At the end of the day, I believe that having an optimistic attitude is essential to seeing success, but it's no substitution for hard work and perseverance. He firmly believes that things will always work out in the end, and this attitude has served him well in his academic and professional pursuits. After all, having a positive attitude does not replace the need for hard work and dedication",1

Working Alone: 
- I prefer to focus on independent work as I can avoid distractions and complete tasks uninterrupted.
- Working alone allows me to make decisions quickly and complete work at my own pace without interruption.
- When I work alone, I can think more clearly and stay organized without needing to answer to anyone else.

Working with Groups: 
- Working with groups can provide a fun environment to exchange ideas, ask questions, and develop teamwork skills.
- Group projects allow everyone to contribute ideas and skills to the same project in ways I can not do alone.
- Working with other people motivates me to push myself further and learn more.",1

An increasingly popular option for some students is to graduate three years by taking online classes or night school. Students should consider all the available options and research, in detail, the potential benefits and drawbacks. While these solutions can save time and money, there are drawbacks to consider. For instance, district high schools offer special programs to help students accelerate their coursework and graduate early. 
Graduating from high school in three years instead of four can be beneficial for certain high school students, but it is not without its drawbacks. Furthermore, it is unclear if the credits earned during these courses will be accepted in four-year colleges and universities, and the level of instruction received in these settings may not fully prepare students for college-level academics. For instance, the online courses may be more difficult than regular classes and the night school may prove to be a challenge with a busy schedule. 

Ultimately, the decision to graduate early should be an informed one. Ultimately, the success or failure of graduation early will depend on the level of personal dedication and the kind of support the student has.. However, some students who have graduated early via these programs struggle with college studies because they have not had the same level of instruction or time to adjust to a college learning environment as their four-year-graduating peers",1

Cellphones are a pervasive technology in our lives today, and new conversations are emerging around their use in the school setting. On one hand, cellphones can have a positive effect on the learning environment by providing students with instant access to information, the ability to collaborate with their peers on projects, and tools to increase their organization and productivity. On the other hand, it is important to consider the potential for cellphones to be distracting, and they may even create an atmosphere of inequity, as some students may not have access to a smartphone or reliable internet connection. By establishing these strategies, educators can head off potential issues that might arise from allowing students access to their cellphones while in class.. 

In order to limit the potential negative impact of cellphones in the classroom, educators can adopt strategies such as setting clear expectations, providing students guidance on how to use their cellphones in an appropriate fashion, and allowing usage only for certain areas of the curriculum",1
"Being able to stand up for one’s beliefs, no matter how unpopular they may be, is a key part of being oneself. It is about understanding who you are, and accepting it, even if that means going against the common norm. In addition, it can be educational and inspiring to those that may follow a similar path. The greatest accomplishment in the world can be being yourself in a world that is attempting to change the person you are.. 
In a world of constant pressure to conform, it can be difficult to truly be oneself. Being oneself is more than just the physical attributes that make up a person’s identity. But is this a successful pursuit? Ultimately, is the greatest accomplishment in the world being yourself in a world that is attempting to change the person you are?

To understand the answer to this question, it is important to look at the meaning behind being oneself. To understand and accept oneself is a powerful thing, and it should be recognized and its power should be recognized. Doing so shows that not only have you accepted yourself, but that you are capable of standing up for something you believe in. It may give them the confidence to follow the path of self-acceptance and discovery.

At the end of the day, though being oneself in a world constantly trying to change the person you are can be a daunting task, it is a great accomplishment that should be celebrated. Our society is constantly trying to change us, to mold us into the people that it prefers. To be true to oneself in a world that is trying to change you is a major accomplishment.

It takes courage and conviction to stay true to oneself in the face of opposition",1
"On the other hand, living an idle life can have a negative effect on one’s life. Therefore, it is essential to recognize the significance of productive work and to strive for success.. 

In terms of physical and mental benefits, people who work productively often experience a stronger sense of purpose and fulfillment in life compared to those who choose to be idle. Additionally, the expression “time is money” rings true when it comes to productive work, as the more one puts into a task, the higher the financial rewards can be. Moreover, successful people often gain greater recognition due to the hard work they put in. 
Productivity versus idleness is a common debate, but the advantages of a productive lifestyle are undeniable. Research indicates that actively working to achieve goals increases energy levels, strengthens mental focus, and boosts motivation. Those who are idle are more likely to suffer from depression or anxiety, and have far fewer career opportunities",1
"In short, advice is invaluable when it comes to making more successful and informed decisions throughout our lives.. For one, looking to mentors, parents, or guardians for advice can be immensely beneficial. By taking the advice and wisdom of others, and applying it to our day-to-day lives, we can gain a more successful and hardworking mindset. A mentor may inspire us to strive for excellence, a parent may teach us the importance of striving for balance, or a friend may encourage us to broaden our perspectives and explore new opportunities. They have a wealth of knowledge, life experience, and wisdom that can take us far - just look at Abraham Lincoln, and the incredible difference he made by ending slavery, after he'd requested counsel from various members of his cabinet. In the same way, advice can change the course of our lives, much like how trying new foods from different chefs can open our eyes and palates to new culinary delights.

It is not just the potential benefits of advice for life decisions, however. 
Taking advice from others can play a pivotal role in shaping life decisions",1
"But on the flip side, there is also evidence that suggests an excessive amount of praise can have a detrimental effect. Research has shown that giving praise to students has a positive effect on their self-esteem, providing them with a sense of accomplishment and gratification. 
Motivating a student without the use of praise can be a difficult but important task for educators and parents. Giving praise too often can lead students to become dependent on external validation, making them less likely to take initiative and self-motivate if it doesn't come with the promise of a reward. 

For this reason, it is important to recognize when praising actually helps, and when it can be harmful. Encouraging students to strive for personal goals and achievements can encourage them to become independent and self-motivated. . While praise may be beneficial in small doses, celebrating successes holistically and emphasizing the journey rather than the result can be just as, if not more, rewarding for a student - and is less likely to have a negative effect",1
"For some, risk-taking may be a difficult prospect, while others may find it hard to shake off the effects of personal problems. Fortunately, there are strategies that students can use to build their self-confidence and overcome these issues. However, there are also numerous challenges that students face when trying to build their self-confidence. Praise and accomplishment are two key elements in building self-confidence; praise can help boost one’s morale and give them the motivation to keep going, while accomplishment can show one’s success and help build a sense of pride. Factors that contribute to a lack of confidence can include social pressures, academic struggles, and a lack of recognition for success. Understanding and addressing these issues, students can make strides when it comes to boosting their self-confidence.. 
Lack of self-confidence in students is a widespread issue that can be attributed to several different factors",1
"For instance, students may benefit from the flexibility of learning from any location and the availability of courses that may not be available in their local area. For example, creating a studying schedule, forming online study groups, and creating a supportive learning environment could help them overcome the difficulties associated with the online learning experience.. It is recommendable for students to establish strategies to help them succeed in their online courses. 
Attending classes online has both pros and cons. Additionally, they have access to a larger range of resources from all over the world. Furthermore, students may be isolated from the interactive learning experience of a traditional classroom and become overwhelmed with the vast amount of study material available online. On the other hand, individuals must be self-motivated and dedicated to study without the physical presence of an instructor and the direct feedback from peers",1
"This approach ignores the importance of patience, resilience, and respect for the journey that growth requires.

It is human nature to want more, to think higher of ourselves and to try and achieve as much as possible. By eschewing the idea that “more is better”, we can focus instead on the small steps that each of us can take to grow closer to our goals, secure in the knowledge that our true worth is not in our possessions or status but in the strength of our character. In a quest for material gain, we might ignore or fail to appreciate the range of experiences that only come with honouring the process of growth. 
Growth is a central theme in our lives. If we let our greed drive us too strongly, our focus shifts away from building a healthier version of ourselves and towards taking whatever we can from those around us. Taking shortcuts in order to obtain success more quickly can lead to undeserved, unearned successes that are ultimately hollow and, in some cases, dangerous.

Being mindful of our motivations is essential to achieving meaningful growth. However, that drive for success must be tempered - too much ambition and a sense of entitlement can lead to an attitude of arrogance and selfishness. On one hand, growth is essential for personal development and fulfilment, but on the other, being overly avaricious can impede our progress. It is the process through which we learn, develop, and become increasingly knowledgeable and independent. Greed is not a viable foundation for personal improvement, but contentment and humility are. ",1
"Additionally, working in a group can create an efficient an effective environment that produces thoughtful results.

On the other hand, when completing simple tasks or those that require little collaboration, working alone can be beneficial. Each brings its own unique advantages and disadvantages, so the decision as to which is more beneficial should be based on the specific situation and task at hand.. 
Working in a group offers the advantage of increased efficiency and faster completion of tasks when compared to working alone. This helps to ensure that all ideas are discussed and considered in order to reach the best possible solution. Working in a group encourages more open communication and better understanding between the members. Additionally, working alone can help to develop greater self-discipline and productivity, as there can be a significant lack of accountability when working in a group.

The communication aspect of working in a group versus working alone is an important aspect to consider. With multiple brains working together and communicating ideas, tasks can be completed in a shorter amount of time than when relying on a single individual. This makes group work ideal for problem-solving and brainstorming. Working solo allows a person to work at their own pace with no distractions, allowing for more focused and uninterrupted work. Conversely, working alone can lead to misunderstanding and can limit the exchange of ideas and opinions.

In conclusion, it is important to consider the pros and cons of both working in a group and alone in order to determine the best method of completing tasks",1
"Additionally, lower-income students could be disproportionately impacted, as they are less likely to have access to childcare and other academic resources outside of school.

Balancing these concerns, it appears that a four-day school week with extended hours is likely to be beneficial in some cases, such as rural communities or schools with tight budgets. 
The question of implementing a four-day school week with extended hours for primary and secondary schools in the United States is complex. 

On the other hand, opponents worry that the extended days could be difficult for working parents to manage, and that student learning could suffer if teachers are unable to cover the same amount of content in fewer days. However, extensive research should be done to ensure the implementation of such a scheme does not negatively impact student learning or access to education for all students.. Additionally, the extended days could give students more time for collaborative projects, experiential learning, and individualized instruction. Proponents of the scheme point out that it could save schools money on staff and transportation, as well as reducing absences and tardiness",1
"By understanding that their successes and failures would build up to a larger, more meaningful achievement, they hoped to stay motivated and focus on their progress in order to improve their own lives.. They had to learn to stay persistent and find the motivation to keep pushing through the challenging moments.

Generic_Name viewed their journey as an opportunity to recognize their internal strengths and use them as fuel for personal growth. They had to learn to accept failure as just another step in getting closer to success. They anticipated the fear of failure they would experience when taking risks, as well as moments of self-doubt when considering how to make progress. 
Generic_Name recounted the process of learning how to push themselves out of their comfort zone in an effort to grow and create something new. 

Despite their commitment to improvement, they acknowledged that there would be considerable obstacles ahead. They realized that the more risks they took, and the more times they failed, the more they would learn and the closer they would be to realizing a new level of personal growth",1
"With a curfew, teenagers would be less likely to be involved in risky activities such as drinking, drug use, or criminal behavior. Establishing a regular curfew could help foster a stronger family bond during these critical teenage years.

In conclusion, implementing a 10 P.M weekday and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers is beneficial for the overall physical and mental health of teenagers, as well as in improving their responsibility, decreasing their risk of late-night trouble, and increasing family time.. By having their teenagers home by an early evening, parents would have the opportunity to have more meals together, engage in conversations, and play games. This teaches them how to be responsible and make choices within the given time and boundary constraints.

Receiving adequate rest is also a key part of good decision-making. On one side, they want their children to experience the freedoms that come with growing up. Adolescents need 8-11 hours of sleep a night, but many experience sleep deprivation due to poor sleep hygiene or staying up late on school nights. Furthermore, teens would be better able to plan which activities they could attend and which would have to be skipped. A curfew could help improve sleep and focus during the day due to a healthier amount of rest.

In addition, the adoption of a curfew could encourage families to spend more time together. A curfew could provide a balance by establishing reasonable expectations for when teenagers should be returning home.

Adopting a 10 P.M weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers would help lead to improved responsibility and decreased risk of late-night trouble. This could easily be prevented by having a structured time for when they should be returning home. On the other, they need to ensure their children are making good choices and staying safe. 
Parents of teenagers often have to juggle conflicting priorities",1
"Many view failure as a dead-end, believing that past mistakes cannot be rectified or that success could never be achieved after a failure. 
Failing in life can provide invaluable lessons and prepare us for entry into the real world. This however, could not be further from the truth. Although failure is a difficult experience, it should not be viewed as a deterrent to future success — instead, recognise it as a stepping stone for growth and improvement. Rather than allowing a fear of failure to stop you from progressing, it is important to acknowledge any errors made and use those lessons to continue striving. Ultimately, even when we fail, we should never give up our dreams and aim to rise above our past mistakes.. It is possible to prove to doubters that success can be achieved after failure by demonstrating a commitment to self-improvement and perseverance in the face of adversity. Taking positive action towards achieving goals, utilizing resources, and seeking guidance from mentors can help increase the likelihood of success",1
"

Taking the time to make our own decisions can also help to solidify our sense of identity. The world will always tell you what to do and who to be, and though it might seem easier to succumb to those pressures, it is important to remember that it is not the right way to achieve success. When we are given opportunities to make our own decisions and pursue what we find interesting or fulfilling, we open up many new doors that the world can't offer. 
Making your own decisions and doing things that you enjoy in life are the keys to creating the greatest successes. We can only truly be successful when we are being true to ourselves and embracing our individual strengths. This is why it is so important to take the time to pursue our own individual paths and discover what truly brings us joy.. 

Making our own decisions and doing things that we enjoy in life can lead to greater successes than simply following what the world wants us to be. We can accomplish so much more when our decisions and pursuits are in line with who we are as people, instead of trying to fit a mold that someone else has created. It can be easy to begin following what the world wants us to be, but this is in direct opposition to finding out who we are and who we want to be. This allows us to develop our skills and gain unique experiences that can ultimately lead to a much greater success than simply following what someone else says",1
"With a curfew, teens receive ample time to finish their school work, participate in extracurricular activities, and contribute to any chores assigned by their parents. It not only encourages positive behavior in teens but also keeps them safe from potential harm. Without this sense of restriction, teenagers may become more vulnerable to getting into dangerous situations due to peer pressure. This creates a positive and productive environment that both employers and customers can benefit from. With a curfew in place, teens feel pressure to finish up assignments and maintain good behavior in their place of employment or while out in public. By having a curfew of 10pm, teens are less likely to be out and about engaging in risky behaviors, such as drinking or drug use. Furthermore, it greatly reduces the chances of teens being involved in a crime or violence during late hours. A curfew helps to regulate the activities that teens engage in and promote a sense of personal discipline in teens. By providing a set time to be home, curfews offer teens structure and guidance that they need to maintain positive behavior.

Compared to not having a curfew, the advantage of establishing a curfew is that it ensures that teens are home at a set time, and it encourages them to be in the house after dark. 

When it comes to the workplace and public, having a curfew allows for a better attitude and behavior among teens. 
Having a curfew is a great way to benefit teenagers. 

In conclusion, the benefits of establishing a 10pm curfew for teenagers far outweigh the alternatives of not implementing it. By having a curfew, teens are encouraged to select activities that are within the restriction of the time, thus, allowing for healthy habits to be formed. We can all agree that a curfew is an essential tool for fostering discipline among our youth.. 

Lastly, an earlier curfew also helps to prevent teens from getting into trouble",1
"By providing incentives to doctors and requiring all citizens to purchase health insurance, both policies can work together to make healthcare more accessible and more affordable.. However, there are also some key differences between them. By providing incentives to doctors, more people would be able to receive medical treatment and would be able to find a doctor more quickly. By requiring all citizens to purchase health insurance, the cost of healthcare can be spread out and made more affordable. Policy 1 focuses on providing access to quality healthcare by mandating that all citizens have health insurance, while Policy 2 focuses on providing incentives to doctors to increase the number of people they treat.

In my opinion, Policy 1 is more beneficial in terms of reducing healthcare costs and increasing access to medical services. 
Policy 1 and Policy 2 have many similarities, such as both focusing on improving the healthcare system. Additionally, by mandating health insurance, more people would be able to access the healthcare they need.

On the other hand, Policy 2 is beneficial in terms of reducing the cost of healthcare services. This would help reduce wait times and reduce the amount of money spent on medical costs.

Overall, I think both policies have their merits and can be used in tandem to improve the healthcare system",1
"When we believe in ourselves and our abilities, our confidence and enthusiasm can manifest in all areas of life, allowing us to enjoy a more fulfilling and successful experience. Positive thinking can also help us to focus on solutions rather than problems, and create greater opportunities for growth. Having a positive attitude can make a world of difference in our lives, helping us to achieve our goals.. It can help to boost our mood and engage us in meaningful activities, giving us the energy and enthusiasm to persevere through challenges. A positive outlook can lead to greater satisfaction and success in school, work, and relationships.

Moreover, asking for advice can serve as a helpful reminder that navigating life’s challenges cannot be done alone. Asking for advice from friends, family members, and mentors can be very empowering as it can give necessary support and practical guidance. Different pieces of advice and opinions can help us understand the situation from multiple angles and draw conclusions or make decisions in a thorough manner. 

In summary, it is advantageous to seek advice from multiple people in order to gain useful and unique perspectives that can help us make better, informed decisions. Asking for advice from a variety of people can provide insight into different perspectives and ideas that may have otherwise been overlooked. 
When it comes to making important decisions, it is often beneficial to seek counsel from multiple sources. By leveraging the valuable insights of the people around us, we can make choices that ultimately have a positive impact on our lives. 

The input of those around us can provide valuable information that’s not accessible in single-source research. This simple act of seeking guidance can help build self-confidence and resilience and likewise, impart knowledge and wisdom from those who’ve gone through similar experiences. In doing so, not only will we learn which choices lead to success, but we can also develop meaningful connections with the people that are around us.. After gathering advice from multiple sources, we can reflect on the counsel we’ve received and develop best possible solutions to our problems",1
"
Winston Churchill's statement that ""success is marked by failure"" is an important reminder that failure is an inevitable part of life and a necessary component of success when striving for our goals. Failure should be seen as an opportunity for learning and growth; it allows us to make mistakes and learn from them, helping us to refine our skills and better our chances of achieving our goals in life. Furthermore, when faced with problem-solving, failure can also teach us to look at things from different perspectives. Instead of becoming discouraged by mistakes, we can use our failures to fuel our motivation and put us on the path to success.",1
"With every step I take towards embracing my true self, I feel more empowered and in tune with my identity. It took a lot of courage for me to go against the grain and make the decision to pursue a degree in something that mattered to me.

Learning to be my true self was one of the greatest accomplishments of my life. It felt empowering to finally make that decision and embrace my true self, in spite of the pressure around me. This didn't sit too well with my family, however I knew it was my passion and I could not ignore it. I wanted so badly to follow the trends and fit in with the crowd, yet my inner voice kept reminding me that I didn't have to be like everyone else. I remember my junior year of high school, when I was really struggling to stay true to my identity. 
Growing up I've always had a hard time being my true self in the world today. From the pressures of peers to the sometimes harsh judgements of society, it can be difficult to feel comfortable in your own skin. It's a liberating process that I couldn't recommend enough to others who are struggling to break their own barriers as well.. 

Another moment that stands out to me is when I was in college and chose to focus my studies on philosophy and history, rather than the more typical path of business studies. Though difficult at times, it was so worth it in the end",1
"
Making mistakes and failure are unavoidable principal components of success. Mistakes and failure are inescapable, and embracing these components can lead to a successful outcome.. Churchill’s advice is sound and provides insight into how to live a successful life. Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill famously stated, “Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.” This quote serves to remind us that failure is actually a prime part of the recipe for success. After making a blunder, it is essential to remain in good spirits and use the mistake to induce positive growth",1
"It implies that each person is ultimately in control of their character and behavior, and it is their decisions that determine what kind of person they become. This can have a lasting effect on their character, as the things they observe can shape their beliefs and values. It is possible to be strongly impacted by those around us, both positively and negatively, and it is our decisions that will determine whether we are actively resisting or submitting to these influences.. Additionally, those around them can pressure them to act in certain ways, and it often requires strength to defy these pressures and stay true to one’s values.

Overall, it is important to remember that while people should strive to be in control of the person they want to be, they must also recognize that the environment they live in can influence their character significantly. However, it is important to acknowledge that this view ignores the fact that people are heavily influenced by those around them, and their environment can have a significant impact on their character. 
The statement ""Your character will be what yourself choose to make it"" is a powerful idea that is worth considering. 

For example, a person may be raised in a household where they see particular behaviors modeled, either positive or negative",1
"Everyone has different perspectives, experiences, and outlooks that could influence the outcome of the decision. 
When it comes to making decisions, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. 

Gathering multiple opinions not only allows you to get a better understanding of the consequences of your decision, but also helps to ensure that you are not overlooking any potential issues or alternate solutions. Doing so can broaden your understanding of the situation, give you a fresh perspective, help you make a more informed decision, and provide validation that the decision you made was the right one. Gathering alternative outlooks and perspectives will help make sure that the decision made is well-informed and unbiased. Additionally, having a variety of opinions can prevent any biases you may have from influencing the decision. Taking other’s opinions into account can also provide validation that the decision you make is in everyone's best interest. Gathering multiple opinions can also help to ensure that the decision you make is well-informed and that no important information was overlooked. Ultimately, gathering multiple opinions is the best way to guarantee an informed and balanced decision.. By taking other people’s views into consideration, you are more likely to make a decision that is in everyone’s best interest.

In conclusion, it is essential to seek multiple opinions when making a decision in order to gain the best outcome. This is why it is important to seek multiple opinions when making decisions",1

Schools have a responsibility to incorporate energy and resource conservation into their everyday practices. Here are five easy ways schools can use to to begin conserving energy and resources. Additionally, school administrators and faculty can hold special assemblies or classroom lessons to teach students about the importance of conservation and ways to get involved.. 

1. Schools can also work to find grants or other funding to support their efforts. Implement water-saving initiatives, such as installing low-flow faucets and toilets, collecting rainwater for landscaping and lawns, and practicing efficient irrigation of lawns.

5. Switch to LED lighting, which is energy efficient and has a longer life span.

3. Utilize renewable energy sources, such as solar power or wind turbines.

To implement these changes, school administrators could create a Green Team committee or task force made up of students and staff to develop and promote green initiatives. Utilize natural light by installing skylights or utilizing natural sunlight wherever possible.

2. Teach students about the importance of conservation and ways they can help - encourage reducing waste, properly disposing of recyclables, and using reusable items wherever possible.

"Perseverance and optimism provide a strong foundation to push forward and  continue the pursuit of success in spite of the setbacks. 
Excerpt: Perseverance, enthusiasm, and optimism are essential ingredients to success. Optimism and enthusiasm empower a person to take action and move forward with the knowledge that success is just around the corner.. Winston Churchill encapsulated this idea in his statement ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" Everyone is destined to experience some degree of failure in their lives, but it's how one deals with these let-downs that makes all the difference",1
"Secondly, working alone gives you the freedom to be as creative as you'd like. You don't have to worry about incorporating another person's ideas or accommodating their wants and needs. Firstly, working alone allows you to have greater control over the task you're tackling. You can explore different ideas without feeling constrained by other people's opinions. This is especially true for tasks that need to be completed on a tight timeline. 
The advantages of working alone compared to working with a group are numerous. For example, if you're working on an essay and only have one day to finish it, you'll likely work faster and more efficiently alone, rather than having to collaborate with a group.. Lastly, it can be more efficient to work alone, since you have fewer obstacles to maneuver",1
"It could also provide students who are unwell with healthier and nutritious meals, give students participating in school sports the nutritional requirements for their sport, and provide those who may be going hungry with a balanced and nutritious diet. 
The topic of changing the school lunch menu is highly important, and carries with it a variety of advantages for students. Finally, students who may not be receiving enough nutrients or variety at home could receive the necessary vitamins and minerals that their bodies need for growth.

The advantages of changing the school lunch menu are extensive. Ultimately, this change could ensure that students get the sustenance they need to thrive.. Additionally, those who participate in school sports could benefit from a menu that is specifically tailored to ensure they are receiving the necessary vitamins and minerals that will help with hydration, energy, and muscle repair. For one, students who are typically unwell or have physical illnesses could greatly benefit from a menu that provides healthier and more nutritious meals. This change could improve the health of students and contribute to overall well-being",1

It is important to consider both the positive and negative impacts of distance learning. On the other hand, there is also the potential for this type of learning to lead to poorer academic performance due to the lack of social interaction and peer motivation.

In conclusion, although there are both positives and negatives when it comes to providing distance learning options, the pros do appear to outweigh the cons. 
Distance learning options have become increasingly popular over the past decade, with growing numbers of students relying on online or video conferencing classes to attend school from home. While the ability to learn from one's own home offers numerous advantages - such as increased flexibility, lower costs, and more control over one's schedule - there are still a number of potential issues that must be taken into account, such as the potential for students to become easily distracted or procrastinate. As such, it is essential that schools embrace this technology and provide the necessary resources to help students take advantage of these opportunities and maximize their potential.. On one hand, there is evidence that distance learning can offer superior academic outcomes due to the focus that students have while working independently. In addition, many students who may feel overwhelmed by the more traditional environment find increased comfort and freedom in the home-based setting",1
"Additionally, working alone can often provide a greater sense of autonomy and creativity.. Without the need to coordinate schedules or consider the needs of others, you have the freedom to organize and structure time in whatever way you feel is most productive for you. Working as part of a team can also lead to better communication and collaboration skills. 

On the other hand, there are also advantages to working alone. 
Working with a group can offer a number of benefits. You are able to devote full attention and concentration to your task until it is completed, leading to better quality of work. Sharing the workload can make for a more efficient use of time and resources, as well as providing multiple perspectives and increasing creativity",1
"However, success does not always come from failing. 
Failure is an important yet often uncomfortable part of life. It is important to strive for success on the path up to it, as well as learn the lessons from mistakes along the way. By understanding the mistakes made and reflecting on how to do better in the future, we can build up our resilience and prepare for future challenges. It can cause a decrease of hope, enthusiasm and faith and make people feel like their efforts are futile. 

For instance, a student who has failed a test may take time to analyze the mistakes they made and use this to focus their future efforts. However, failure can also be used to motivate people to succeed. Successful results can come from being diligent and methodical in any endeavor.. This forward-thinking can help the student develop the persistence and determination to succeed",1
"By engaging in creative activities such as painting, writing music, or performing on stage, students acquire skills that go beyond the traditional academic curriculum and can help them become more creative thinkers. Therefore, a persuasive essay about why students should take art, music, and drama classes could include the following points: the development of creativity, the potential for improved academic performance, the gain of practical skills and knowledge, and the opportunity to explore various creative pursuits in a safe and structured environment.. This knowledge can be applied to various aspects of their lives, such as studying, developing creativity, and providing them with the opportunity to pursue their interests in a safe, structured environment. 
One of the greatest educational benefits of taking an art, music, or drama class as an elective in school is the development of creativity. Knowledge learned in these classes such as how to read and interpret music, create and understand art, and perform and interpret a dramatic script can be useful for college and job applications. Furthermore, collaborative activities such as ensemble performance and group theatres can help students gain important interpersonal skills such as teamwork and leadership that are beneficial for college and professional endeavors.

By taking art, music, and drama classes, students can gain an in-depth understanding of the various aspects of these creative pursuits. Additionally, taking art, music, and drama classes can help improve a student's academic performance, as research has shown that students who participate in creative activities tend to score higher on tests, think more critically, and have better problem solving skills.

In addition to academic performance, taking art, music, and drama classes can provide students with practical skills and knowledge that are beneficial for college and career prospects",1
"From stunning mountain ranges to pristine beaches, Europe is an ideal destination for travelers looking to broaden their horizons. Similarly, owning and operating a construction company can be a rewarding endeavor. For those brave enough to take on the challenge, skydiving can be an incredible, enjoyable experience. 
Skydiving has been increasingly popular in recent years, as it offers a unique adrenaline rush and stunning views of the world below. Furthermore, Europe is a continent full of interesting countries with distinct cultures and attractions worth seeing. Through genealogy, we can learn more about our ancestors and where we come from, connecting us with our collective past.. There is a lot of time and effort that goes into starting a construction business, but with the right research, preparation, and perseverance, it can be a successful venture. Visiting one's home country can be a meaningful experience for many, as we can often find a deeper understanding and appreciation of our past and roots by spending time in the places where our stories began. Similarly, understanding one's family history can also be an eye-opening journey of discovery",1
"But I realized that I still had something to prove, and my determination to work hard and succeed kept me going. I spent the whole summer practicing every day, and by the end of the season I became one of the top players in my city.

This experience taught me that success comes from perseverance and hard work. 
Reflection on Failure:

I have faced failure many times in my life, but there is one experience that stands out. Failing is a tough pill to swallow, but if you take the time to reflect on it and work hard to reach your goals, success can be right around the corner.. I was devastated and considered giving up on the sport. When I was in high school, I applied to a soccer academy with the hope of playing against some of the best players in my region. Unfortunately, I did not make the team. Winston Churchill said, ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,"" and I believe this statement is true",1
"Agreement plays a significant role here, as people who are able to empathize and understand one another's point of view tend to form more positive impressions. However, one is never truly stuck with their first impression, as it is possible to change them by having new experiences, being open-minded, and forming positive relationships.. 
First impressions can be formed many ways; whether through physical and emotional events, such as the way a person looks and acts, or through various environmental factors, such as the people, places, monuments, and conversations a person is exposed to. 

In conclusion, first impressions can be impacted by a person's past or environment. Conversely, communication that lacks agreement can lead to negative impressions. 

The conversation between two people is a big factor in the formation of first impressions. Specific examples of how this can be achieved include gaining new experiences, being more open-minded and tolerant to new ideas, and forming positive relationships. 

Although the past and environment can impact first impressions, it is possible to change them. It is possible for the past experiences or environment to affect first impressions. For example, if someone has experienced a series of negative events, they may be more likely to have a negative outlook on life and be less likely to have a positive initial impression. The way two people communicate to one another, as well as the places and people a person comes in contact with, can affect initial impressions. It is worth noting, however, that first impressions are not always accurate, and getting to know a person better can often lead to more positive and lasting impressions",1
"Not only will students benefit directly from performing community service, but our community as a whole will be enriched by their involvement. By requiring students to perform community service, it will teach them to be compassionate and generous, while also becoming better citizens and members of society. 
One of the most important responsibilities of students is to give back to their community. They will learn that their actions matter and have an impact beyond their individual lives.

For all these reasons, I urge you to consider making community service a required part of the curriculum. Community service can help students foster relationships with members of their community, something they may not have done otherwise. Lastly, requiring students to perform community service will also give them a sense of responsibility and ownership of their own lives. Engaging in community service allows students to explore possible career areas by getting a firsthand look at different jobs that they may not have been aware of otherwise. Thank you for your consideration.. It may even help them to become more empathetic people, develop leadership capabilities, and even boost their career achievements.

In addition, students can use community service to gain skills and important experience in areas of their interests",1
"This reduces the worrying parents often have about their children being exposed to bad influences outside of home. 
Online and video conferencing classes have become increasingly popular for students who are being homeschooled. Not only do these classes provide convenience, they also offer safety, improved focus, and the assurance of avoiding bad influences from others. Without the distractions of other students or teachers, the student is able to stay focused on the content and work more efficiently. Whether it be for safety, focus, or to avoid bad influences, these classes can be a great asset to any homeschooling curriculum.. 

Additionally, online classes provide a level of focus that can be hard to replicate in a traditional classroom setting. 

Many parents who homeschool their children struggle to provide them in-person educational opportunities, especially with the already reduced resources available to homeschooled students. When it comes to a homeschooled student, this concentrated form of learning is especially beneficial, as it can enhance their academic skills and levels of understanding. 

All in all, online and video conferencing classes are ideal for homeschooled students. Online and video conferencing classes allow homeschooled students to access a variety of classes, often from the comfort and safety of their own home",1
"Self-belief and perseverance are essential components of success, and it is important to be prepared for the possibility of failure. Unfortunately, when successful people are admired or their achievements praised, it can often breed envy or jealousy in others, which can be damaging to both the successful person and those who feel envious.

A plan for personal success should include setting and maintaining goals, developing a positive attitude, and consistently making efforts and putting in the necessary work to reach the desired objectives. Having an open mind and being open to learning new things is essential, and maintaining focus on goals despite external pressures is a must. Keeping secrets can be detrimental to success as well, since making connections with other people and building a strong network are crucial elements of achieving success. 
Success is something many of us strive for, and many believe it is attainable through hard work and dedication. Family support can provide needed encouragement and moral support to persevere when going through trying times.

However, jealousy and envy from others can hinder success if we let it. Achieving success often requires enthusiasm, education, and family support. With the right attitude, enthusiasm, education, and family support, success can be within reach.. Enthusiasm and motivation are critical for powering through hard work and obstacles, and education can provide the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed. When faced with failure, it is critical to take the time to reflect on the experience before moving on and finding alternative paths.

In addition, it is important to stay open to creativity and new ideas along the way",1
"Finally, it’s important to practice passing drills in training and games, as this will help you build muscle memory and help you know when and how to pass the ball. Additionally, try verbalizing the pass you plan on making before you make it. During games, be aware of potential passing options from the moment the ball is kicked. This will help you make the right decision quickly and not miss out on chances to connect with teammates. With practice and dedication, these strategies can help you remember to pass the ball during games.. 
One effective strategy for remembering to pass the ball in soccer is to focus on your teammates, both while playing the ball and when you don’t have it. This will help you develop a sense of mental discipline which, in the heat of the game, will help you decide when the best time to pass the ball is",1
"Additionally, this can also cause students to become overwhelmed and tired from longer days, leading to low morale and reduced motivation, resulting in decreased attendance and poorer grades. On the other hand, lack of proper resources such as textbooks, additional staff, and educational materials may lead to lower quality of education and limit students' ability to truly benefit from the additional school hours. Furthermore, longer hours may discourage them from skipping school, leading to higher attendance records. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that adequate resources and support are available to Afghan students before extending their school day.. On one hand, having additional time spent in school would give students more time to understand the material and complete their work, leading to improved grades. 
The increased amount of school hours could have both positive and negative effects on Afghan students' attendance, grades, and educational life",1
"This shift in my understanding of first impressions has helped me to connect more authentically with others.. From the way I introduce myself to someone new, to the way I greet a friend when we meet, I know that the small details of an initial interaction can have a tremendous impact on how people feel about one another. 
I have always been aware of the power of first impressions. Over time, I have come to recognize that it isn't always the first words or gestures that matter, but rather how I engage with someone that is most important. My own experiences have taught me that first impressions can be difficult to get right, yet they can have a lasting impression on how I am viewed and perceived by others",1

My teachers have been an invaluable resource in this process, sharing their perspective on continuing my education by attending a community college or taking extra classes",1
"If the experience is successful, I will consider expanding my volunteering activity to a larger scale. I've made a list of activities, from easiest to hardest, which I believe would benefit my local community. 

Next, I can participate in neighborhood clean-up efforts. This is an easy way to get involved in improving the lives of those around me. 
I can make a contribution to my community in a number of ways. 

The first on my list would be volunteering at a local food pantry, helping to sort and pack grocery bags for those in need. Working on the community garden provides access to healthy, fresh produce in food insecure areas.

To begin this journey, I'm going to research and experiment with volunteering at the food pantry. Even the smallest actions can create big changes.. I want to see what is involved and what I can bring to this type of work. I can donate my time to help keep my community clean and litter-free. 

Other activities I've listed involve mentoring youth in the area or taking part in a local community garden. By mentoring young people, I'm contributing to the development of future generations. 

I'm hopeful that my efforts will positively impact people locally, nationally and globally",1
"However, embracing the idea of not being yourself and departing from expectations and obligations can often be an accomplishment. 

One thing to remember is that while it is important to be yourself and be independent, it is equally important to still be mindful of rules and regulations. To go against expectations and pursue the path you really want to be on is a brave choice to make, but it is also necessary for a fulfilling life. Making decisions that respect authority can be an integral part of success, in many areas of life, and following the rules may provide a much-needed structure or sense of security. 
Being yourself may not always be the most natural or easy approach in life, and many of us go out of our way to try and be someone we are not in order to fit in or make others happy. There are always consequences, both positive and negative, to following or not following rules. Being flexible and adaptable to new opportunities and experiences can open up our lives to unimaginable possibilities that could not have been forecasted. Ultimately though, at the end of the day, having the power to make our own decisions, for that one person who grew up in a conservative family, is a testament to a successful life journey.. After all, it takes courage and an independent mindset to make decisions for yourself and go against the grain of what is expected.

Take for example the classic story of a person from a conservative family, who may be expected to pursue a certain career or study specific subjects, but harbors a passion for something completely different",1
"

Personally, I view reading as a way to escape and open up my world to new ideas and perspectives. Studies have found that different genres of books can help with different areas of cognitive development. 
Reading books helps to develop our brains in several ways. I especially love to curl up with a good book on a rainy day or when I'm feeling overwhelmed; it helps me relax and refocus my thoughts.. Participating in a book club can further increase these benefits by providing a community for discussion and diversifying our reading list. For instance, fiction has been linked to improved empathy, while non-fiction can expand our knowledge base and critical thinking skills",1
"I have presented my findings to the school's administration and look forward to seeing how they respond.. However, they do agree that the school should provide more resources and support for students, as well as prioritize mental health. These alternative solutions could be beneficial to the student body and could benefit the school in the long run. 
After surveying the opinions of my peers, I have found that the majority do not support the idea of adding 1.5 hours to the school day. Some suggested alternatives that I gathered from my peers include increasing the number of classes with fewer students, implementing more activities that promote equal access for all students, and providing more student-teacher mentoring opportunities",1
"For people who are considering their future college or course choices, allowing them to visit a workplace and learn more about the various roles and responsibilities of those who work there could be invaluable. Providing visitors with an opportunity to tour the workplace can be a great way of doing this, allowing potential collaborators to gain a valuable insight into the company and its values. Having this insight can help visitors make a more educated decision when applying to schools or jobs, understanding more clearly what they are getting into.

Allowing people to tour the workplace also offers the potential to benefit the company. The introduction of more informed and engaged visitors can lead to increased consumer loyalty, improved understanding of company operations, and positive word-of-mouth recommendations. Seeing firsthand the intricacies of a functioning, successful business can give visitors an understanding of how a company operates and what the job roles entail. Furthermore, it can increase brand recognition and potentially draw new staff who can bring fresh insights and innovative approaches to the workplace.

In today's competitive job market, it is essential for companies to set themselves apart. It prepares them to make more informed decisions when it comes to their career paths.

By allowing people to tour a workplace, it can also provide a unique perspective for people who are interested in the work being done there. Ultimately, with the potential benefits that can come from hosting visitors and tours, it is clear to see why it can be a valuable asset to companies.. 
The potential benefits of allowing visitors to tour a workplace are immense",1
"On one hand, it has enabled us to become more connected to people around the world, making long-distance relationships possible and providing us with a wealth of information about the lives of others. In the workplace, employees can now communicate more effectively and efficiently through email and other online tools. While it has enabled us to more easily stay connected, it has also forced us to prioritize virtual conversations over physical ones. Although technology has made communication more efficient and convenient, we must be mindful of its potential to hinder our relationships and maintain balance in our lives.. 
Technology has drastically changed the way humans interact with one another. On the other hand, the reliance on these technologies has taken a toll on our personal connections, as we often connect with our coworkers and acquaintances through screens instead of face-to-face meetings.

In the realm of social media, technology has connected us to people in unprecedented ways, allowing us to maintain contact with long-lost friends and meet new people from all over the world. On the other hand, it has also created a form of disconnection between people, as we increasingly engage with a virtual world instead of the physical one.

The effects of technology on human contact can be seen in virtually every aspect of life. However, the sheer amount of information shared online has created a feeling of competition between users, leading to comparison and envy, which can be detrimental to our mental health. 

Overall, technology has impacted the lives of people in both positive and negative ways. This has led to an increase in productivity and ease of communication, making it easier to stay in touch with colleagues over long distances",1
"For example, a student who is struggling to write a difficult essay may need to rely on themselves in order to overcome the challenge. It is impossible to progress without the ability to make informed decisions and face the consequences alone. It is the ability to make decisions and cope with the consequences, both good and bad, in order to achieve a certain goal. 

The same applies to nature, where animals and plants must use self-reliance to survive in their ever-changing environment. Seeking help and guidance from others can be helpful, but it is ultimately up to the student to make the final decisions and take the necessary steps to reach success. It cultivates a sense of independence and autonomy that is necessary for growth and personal development. 
Self-reliance is an essential human characteristic that is both necessary and beneficial. 

The thought process behind self-reliance is personal and divergent. 

In conclusion, self-reliance is an incredibly valuable trait that is both necessary and beneficial. 

In real life, self-reliance can be seen as a problem-solving tool when faced with various obstacles. It requires the individual to assess the situation, consider potential options, and weigh the pros and cons of each decision before making a final choice. They must navigate their surroundings, make decisions, and weather the consequences in order to secure resources and thrive. The decisions we make can have a considerable impact on the outcome, so it is important to consider all the consequences and think logically before we act.

When making the decision of which job to pursue, consider the reasons why you are drawn to each job and how those interests can help you become successful",1
"Additionally, if these classes are not taught in an engaging manner, students may not be able to gain any meaningful knowledge from them. 

Overall, I believe that music, drama, and art classes should be included as part of the curriculum but not made compulsory. 

On the other hand, some students may not have an interest in these subjects, and making them compulsory may make them feel unmotivated and annoyed. 
Making music, drama, and art classes compulsory for students can offer many advantages. It is a great opportunity for students to learn to express themselves, explore their creativity, and develop the ability to think critically and artistically. Learning music, drama, and art can also help students better understand different cultures and viewpoints, and add to their overall educational experience. This would help them get the most out of the classes and keep them engaged, while those who would prefer to avoid them should be allowed to do so.. If students have a genuine interest in these subjects, they should be encouraged to pursue them further",1
"
Research indicates that pairing older students with younger students through school programs can have a positive impact on both parties, regardless of age. The positive reinforcement from teaching younger students can be an invaluable experience for older students, resulting in increased self-satisfaction and confidence. This is due to the fact that older students tend to have more advanced knowledge in the given subject, as well as more experience and skills working in a team. Studies conducted suggest that younger students are more likely to excel academically when working and collaborating with older peers. 

Older students, on the other hand, benefit from enrolling in peer-mentoring programs by gaining more responsibility and increasing their social skills. 

Overall, school programs that pair different age groups have numerous benefits for both younger and older students, providing them with invaluable knowledge and allowing them to gain key interpersonal skills.",1
"On top of this, students have the potential to benefit socially and educationally from distant learning, with virtual classes being a great way for people from different cultures, countries and backgrounds to connect and learn. 
The rise of distant learning has had a massive impact on students in recent decades. With the increasing influence of technology on today's generation, students are now able to access educational content and resources from virtually anywhere, taking advantage of opportunities that weren't available before. Video conferencing has enabled teachers to have face-to-face interactions with their students even at a distance, providing that important personal connection that can often be missing from online courses. As remote working and online education continues to increase, the potential benefits of distant learning for students only looks set to grow.",1
"To gain even more insight, I visited the library and read through multiple books about the profession and spoke to experienced individuals who have already pursued the same career. They provided me with valuable advice, helping me gain a better understanding of the potential career choice. 
After extensive research into the career path I'm interested in, including how much people can make and what the job entails, I decided to ask for advice from my parents, older siblings, and counselors. I asked them questions regarding their job, wages, and if they could provide any tips or guidance.  All of these efforts provided me with the necessary information to make an informed decision about the career I want to pursue.",1
"He was a passionate believer in hard work and the value of individuals coming together to serve each other and their country. People of all backgrounds need to come together to ensure that we are able to effectively and efficiently solve any issues that arise. Of course, mutual respect is key to this endeavor.

The sentiments that Jefferson promoted are as relevant now as they've ever been. As technology continues to advance and more people are relying on collaborative talents, it is essential to remember the lessons that Jefferson taught us about the need to work hard and treat others with respect. His unwavering commitment to ensuring the longevity of these principles can continue to serve us ####and help us move towards a brighter and more productive future.. We must never forget the importance of values such as hard work and respect for each other. 
Thomas Jefferson was a prominent American statesman and Founding Father who is most famously remembered for writing the Declaration of Independence. According to Jefferson, respect and collaboration are integral parts of any successful society.

These beliefs of Jefferson's still resonate today, especially in the modern workplace",1
"His work encourages people to broaden their interests, break away from convention, and to seize new opportunities whenever possible. His work focused primarily on the aspects of self-awareness and self-reliance and emphasized the potential within each individual to break free from societal and religious conventions. Focus on any one profession for growth and development is important, but it is also important not to limit oneself, or to let external pressures dictate one's decisions and actions. 

In modern society, Mr. For personal growth, development, and true impact on the community, people should take their professional focus seriously, while also using each situation to gain experience and push the boundaries of what has already been done.. This is in order to foster individual growth and development, expand oneself intellectually, and challenge the way things are traditionally done.

In conclusion, the message of Ralph Waldo Emerson resonates today: People should always strive to learn something new and take every opportunity to feed their intellectual curiosity. Emerson's message still rings true. 
Ralph Waldo Emerson was a renowned American essayist, lecturer, and poet, who was known for his transcendentalist beliefs. His major message was that each individual should strive to be independent and embrace novel experiences for their growth and development",1

The debate surrounding the issue of cellphones in school is complex. On the other hand, the presence of cellphones in school could be a huge distraction from learning, as students can become easily engrossed in their devices instead of focusing on their education. It is clear that allowing cellphones in school requires careful analysis and consideration of its potential implications.. On one hand, providing students with the opportunity to have a cellphone in school could enhance trust and communication between parents and teachers, and could also enable students to keep up with their work and contact each other quickly. Other concerns include potential violations of rules and the possibility of cyberbullying",1
"On the other hand, detractors claim that longer school hours can be detrimental to students’ physical and mental health, ultimately leading to greater burnout and decreased academic achievement. Studies have shown that when students have too little sleep and too much stress, their academic performance and motivation decreases. Furthermore, the mental and physical strain of extended school hours could be a contributing factor to the rising rates of anxiety and depression among teens. 

After giving careful consideration to the arguments on both sides, I believe that longer school hours should not be implemented. Supporters cite the benefits of giving students more time to develop their learning and practice the skills needed for academic success. 

Ultimately, I believe that the best way to ensure academic success is to provide students with a balanced education that puts their mental and physical health first. 
There are valid arguments to be made both for and against extending school hours. This could involve shorter school hours and more optional activities such as sports and art classes, as well as providing students with access to mental health support services. By providing students with these means of support and free choice, we can ensure that their academic performance and well-being are both prioritized.. In addition, proponents argue that having more time in school allows teachers to cover more content in greater depth, giving students the opportunity to delve more deeply into the topics they are learning about. While having more time in school can provide students with opportunities to strengthen their academic skills, it can also be detrimental to their health and well-being",1
"It can also be a great distraction, leading us away from productive activities and into a world of endless scrolling and mindless entertainment. 
Technology has become an integral part of our everyday lives, with almost every facet of our existence affected in some way. To maintain a healthy relationship with technology, it is important to recognize the potential drawbacks of its use, so that its bright potential can be harnessed without all the unnecessary risks.. On the other hand, technology can also be an isolating force in our lives, as it replaces traditional interactions with virtual ones, creating an artificial atmosphere. On the one hand, technology has greatly improved our lives in many ways, providing us with easier access to information and more efficient ways to communicate. 

The effects of technology on our lives are very complex, and it is clear that technology can have both positive and negative influences. It has also opened up new opportunities to stay connected with friends, family, and loved ones, no matter the distances that lie between us",1
"Schools around the world have instituted policies regarding the use of devices in the classroom, with varying levels of success. There are several strategies for mitigating the negative effects of device usage in the classroom, such as discouragement of use during instruction or implementation of specific software and tools for educational purposes. These strategies are meant to harness the potential of technology while limiting the interference of digital distraction.. The presence of devices in the classroom can be a source of distraction, leading to decreased academic performance. 
Recent studies have been conducted to research the impact of device usage on students' academic performance",1
"Every individual has their own set of experiences that shape them, and therefore, the ability to better prepare for these situations will depend on acknowledging our past experiences and using them to form our future actions. Taking lessons from the past situations and feeling comfortable enough to properly apply them can be the difference between being more confident and successful in our first impressions, or perpetuating embarrassing, and sometimes embarrassing, situations. This can be crucial when it comes to embarrassing situations that can happen in social settings. The goal then to is to learn from past experiences in order to gain the necessary skills to successfully stand up to and prepare for potential embarrassing situations.. 
As humans, we are constantly evaluating, learning, and growing through our experiences. It can be said that our past experiences shape our future first impressions, either through how we prepare ourselves or how we interpret the reactions and feelings of those around us",1
"On the other hand, however, there are a few potential drawbacks to consider. Additionally, many students are self-directed and mature enough to handle the rigors of completing high school early. Furthermore, without these experiences, students may struggle to develop the very skills necessary for academic and professional success. While it may be a great option for certain individuals who are ready to move on to the next phase of their lives, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks and ensure that students are still able to enjoy and benefit from the high school experience.. 
Finishing high school in three years is an intriguing proposition that has gained significant traction in the last few years. On the one hand, completion ahead of schedule is an attractive concept to many students who are eager to begin college and make an impact on the world. The most significant concern is that students may miss out on important experiences, such as extracurricular activities or even friendships, if they leave high school too quickly. 

Overall, whether or not completing high school in three years is a good idea is a decision that will vary from person to person",1
"

Physical activities, such as sports, have the added benefit of increasing physical strength and endurance. 

Recent research shows that students who get involved in extracurricular activities like sports, music, or art can show an improved academic performance in school. Studies have also proven that students who participate in activities after school show better social and emotional wellbeing. This is because extracurricular activities give children a place to meet and bond with other children outside of the regular school environment which helps in developing a better understanding of how to interact with peers and handle social situations. This helps children learn better in class and improves their concentration. 

Parents should be interested in their children's extra-curricular activities as they provide a chance for them to grow and make a positive difference in their lives. Furthermore, participating in sports helps children maintain a healthy lifestyle and build up a stronger immune system. The positive long-term effects of extracurricular activities include increased self-confidence, better time management skills, improved discipline, and a better understanding of how important working together as a team is.  All of these benefits can not only help students succeed now but also benefit them in the future.",1
"It can help us to better cope with stress and workplace pressures, as well as to cultivate better relations with colleagues. We can confidently believe in our ability to achieve our goals, utilizing our positive attitude as an important tool to realize our ambitions.

In addition, having a positive attitude can be a very valuable asset in the working environment. Employees with a good attitude can inspire others around them and are often looked upon more favorably by employers due to the positive attitude that they possess.

Ultimately, having a positive attitude is essential for leading a successful and fulfilling life. 
Having a positive attitude in life is essential for achieving a successful and fulfilling lifestyle. Having a positive attitude can also make us more approachable to others and can help us to stand out to employers. By embracing a positive outlook, we can better create relationships with those around us, allowing us to form strong and meaningful connections to those we interact with. Positive thinking can also help us stay motivated and feel motivated to work towards our goals. Taking steps to cultivate the right mindset can help us to create meaningful connections with others, stay motivated to pursue our goals, and become more productive in our job and career.",1
"Additionally, having a positive attitude can lead to more productive problem-solving, increased motivation and improved overall mental wellbeing. Positive self-talk can help reframe challenging situations, providing a more realistic and balanced perspective and giving individuals the encouragement and motivation needed to cope with any challenges they may face. It is important to remember that mistakes and failures can lead to growth, and having a positive outlook is the key to navigating difficult times.. In order to maintain a positive attitude when things don't go as planned, such as getting a bad grade on a test or quiz, practicing positive self-talk can be particularly beneficial. 
Having a positive mindset and developing strategies for how to cope with potential failures can have a significant impact on one's response to difficult times",1
"It is important to create a good learning environment at home where students can focus and absorb the material while still developing their social skills. Furthermore, the fact that they can still be in touch with their teachers and peers makes this a valuable experience. Moreover, in an era when screens are ubiquitous, there is an increased potential for students to take advantage of the situation and get distracted with activities such as social media, online gaming or shopping, thus making it difficult for them to concentrate and learn. 

Attending classes from home has the potential to be a rewarding experience if students use it prudently. This offers a number of advantages, allowing students greater flexibility, enabling them to manage classes and work commitments efficiently. 
The increase in advances in technology has revolutionized learning, making it possible for students to attend classes from home. Being isolated from the classroom environment can make it difficult for students to develop their communication skills. Ultimately, the success of this privilege relies on students taking advantage of the opportunity to further their learning.. 

However, this privilege also presents certain drawbacks, such as a lack of face-to-face interaction between teachers and students, as well as between students themselves",1
"They can offer students the chance to pursue their passions, as well as to expand beyond the content taught in school, which can lead to better academic performance and career advantages in the future. 

The advantages of after school programs are plentiful. They can also be beneficial for social development, as they provide the opportunity to make connections with like-minded peers in the same field.

On the other hand, there are also disadvantages to after school programs such as the possibility of overscheduling. 
After school programs have become increasingly popular within the last decade, offering students the chance to extend the content they have learnt during the day, or to pursue a passion, such as creative writing or coding. When comparing the different programs, there are certain factors I had to look at, such as their cost, content and duration.

I have researched many success stories of students who have participated in after school programs and have seen great improvement in their academic work and development of important life skills such as communication and problem-solving. By researching near my area, I have found a plethora of after school programs, ranging from extracurricular activities such as photography and art, to more academic lectures such as coding and essay writing. Additionally, some after school programs may require additional costs such as transportation or the purchasing of educational materials.. It is important to research the different options carefully and assess if the student is likely to benefit from the program before fully committing",1
"This can be a difficult skill to learn since teenagers are still developing their sense of identity and finding direction in life. This can lead to an atmosphere of fear and hesitancy when making decisions.

No matter the home environment, it is important for teens to recognize their own intrinsic value. 
Growing up in a supportive family environment can have a tremendous impact on decision making for teens. Learning to trust and be true to themselves is a valuable asset that can help teens succeed in academics, relationships, and life.. Having a secure and understanding home to return to gives them the confidence to make decisions that are right for them and follow their own path. On the other hand, growing up in an unsupportive home can be an obstacle for teens who may feel judged and disrespected. It is essential for teens to have the strength of mind to understand that they don't have to conform to the expectations of others in order to be accepted or to succeed",1
"It provides students with the opportunity to focus and align their educational choices and creative strategies to support their future ambitions. 
Committing to a career at a young age can be hugely beneficial for students. For these reasons all students should start to choose their career at a young age.. 

Ultimately, by committing to a career at a young age, students get a head start on their professional development. It can also provide students with the direction they need to focus their studies and other extracurricular activities on a subject they are passionate about. For example, students can leverage their course of study to develop their individual passions and talents that support their understanding of their chosen field. 

Besides the practical benefits, there are many creative strategies to express oneself through a career. By deciding on their career at a young age, students are able to apply and explore the use of the creative strategies that further demonstrate their enthusiasm, knowledge and expertise for the chosen field. Starting early helps prepare students for their future, while teaching them valuable life skills such as budgeting, networking, and prioritization",1
"On the other hand, students who have been at the school for some time may not be used to the new menu and could find it difficult to adapt to the changes. Therefore, consideration must be given to the potential effects on existing students both with diets and those with a long history at the school, to ensure that everyone's needs are taken into account.. 
Introducing a new menu in the school cafeteria could have positive and negatives effects depending on the type of food offered. On the one hand, it would provide more choice for students who need to follow specific dietary requirements and may have been limited by the existing range of options",1
"It may also lead to potential cyberbullying in school as well as encourage cheating. It can be a major distraction for students, detracting from their focus on academics. Furthermore, it is possible that allowing phones in school unfairly gives an advantage to students who can afford the latest technology, potentially creating a digital divide.. In addition, the use of phones in school can act as a safety measure, as having a phone on them gives students the ability to easily contact parents and guardians in case of an emergency.

On the other hand, there are certain drawbacks to allowing students to use their phones in school. 
Proponents of allowing students to bring their phones to school argue that phones offer a number of educational benefits such as access to educational apps, online resources, and digital work collaboration",1
"Conversely, physical education often focuses more on individual efforts and creative endeavours, providing a comfortable environment for students to express themselves and have fun. Over the centuries, soccer has become a popular sport in many cultures and it has been embraced as a way to promote physical education. It teaches skills like cooperation, communication, and discipline, which can be useful in the classroom. Playing soccer helps to increase physical fitness, strengthens agility, and promotes self-confidence. It also encourages creativity and problem-solving abilities. 

With its emphasis on teamwork, speed, and skill, soccer is a great way to build skills. 

Although soccer and physical education share many similarities, there are also differences in the way they work. They can help to develop useful skills, foster enjoyment, and provide a much needed break from school work.. 

Physical education not only helps to build physical abilities, but it can also lead to enjoyment. Its roots extend back to ancient Greece, where it was played in the form of the ball-game Harpastum. It can be an escape that can help students to focus and recharge. Soccer follows more specific rules and regulations than physical education, making it more competitive and fast-paced. Participating in physical activities creates a more relaxed atmosphere, taking the mind off of the pressures of schoolwork. 
Soccer is one of the oldest sports in the world, with a rich and vibrant history. 

Overall, soccer and physical education both have great value in terms of providing physical and mental benefits",1
"Identifying and creating for yourself a realistic, positive attitude which remains open minded to all possibilities is the best approach for finding success in any endeavour.. Additionally, a pessimistic outlook can also tarnish relationships, making it difficult to form meaningful connections with those around you.

Ultimately, having the right balance between optimism and pessimism is key to finding success in life. It is important to recognize the potential risks and difficulties, but also have an underlying positive outlook which encourages progress. With this situation, an individual may be too eager to believe that any obstacles can be easily overcome, when in reality additional challenges may be encountered. On the other hand, adopting a more practical and measured approach, one that does not involve ignoring potential roadblocks or issues, can allow an individual to remain calm and remain focused on their goal.

Having a negative attitude can also be damaging, as it is easy to become overwhelmed and disheartened. A pessimistic attitude is unlikely to lead to fruitful endeavors, as it can prevent an individual from taking risks or challenging themselves in worthwhile ways. 
Having a positive attitude is often touted as a key to success, but is it really the only factor to consider in life? It is true that having an optimistic outlook has a range of benefits – it can make it easier to accomplish goals and build relationships – but there are also times when maintaining a neutral, or even negative, attitude is more relevant.

Going in with an overly-positive mindset can be counterproductive, as it may lead to unrealistic expectations and a frustrating lack of progress",1
"It would give them time to work and gain experience in the field of their choice, it would mean they would be better able to focus on their studies, and it would also serve to prepare them adequately for higher education.

Considering these points, it is clear that a three-year high school program is not appropriate and should not be allowed. 
Despite some students' enthusiasm for a three-year high school graduation program, there are many reasons why it should not be allowed. Extracurricular activities are also affected, as students must choose between priority activities that will help them get into college and activities that better reflect their interests.

Furthermore, a lack of a three year program could have several benefits for the student. Most readily apparent are the limited availability to attend classes after school and the high stress levels involved when attempting to fit a four year program into three years. It can cause stress and affects extracurricular activities, while the lack of such a program could prove beneficial to many.",1
"Working together increases the likelihood of procrastination and delays, and it can be difficult to stay on track, making it essential for members to stay on task and dedicated to achieve long-term objectives. In addition, group dynamics and differences in opinion can often lead to competition and resentment between members which can hinder the overall project's effectiveness.

While working alone can be more efficient in some cases, it can be more limited than when working in a group. It is important for teams to recognize the advantages of each approach, and understand when it's beneficial to work together or independently in order to get work done efficiently and effectively.. One person cannot replicate the collective creativity that true collaboration can provide, and in most cases an individual's work will remain somewhat confined to what they already know. Negotiations between members within the group can also motivate creative resolutions, trusted strategic counsel, and the ability to openly exchange opinions without fear of judgement.

However, there are some downsides to working in a group as well. Working collaboratively allows everyone to contribute their own ideas, skills, and knowledge to a project, creating a collective hypothetical pool from which the group can draw. Working alone can also create a sense of isolation, and it can be difficult for an individual to stay motivated and productive without the extra support of group members.

In conclusion, there are both pros and cons to both group and solo work. The combined skillsets of the members provide the creative and technical skills necessary to achieve a goal which may be beyond the capability of any individual alone.

Ultimately, working in a group encourages innovation through the synthesis of multiple points of view, resulting in fresh ideas and problem-solving empowered by diversity. 
Working together in a group has many benefits when compared to working alone, which can make a bigger impact and often be more efficient than solitary efforts",1
"I have found that a degree in computer science or engineering from an accredited university is highly recommended, as well as the completion of internships or entry-level jobs with technology companies. Furthermore, I plan to pursue leadership roles in school and community organizations, as well as complete relevant volunteer work, so that I can develop more experience and gain skills to help me excel in my chosen career.. Additionally, I need to have excellent problem-solving skills, knowledge of coding languages, and the ability to think outside the box. I am also researching different college programs to find the best fit for me. To that end, I am taking some college-level courses in programming and mathematics that will both help me prepare for college and give me a head start on my studies. 
I am considering becoming a computer engineer after high school, so I have done some research into what qualifications and experiences I need to prepare myself for this profession",1

Improvising when trying to be someone is a great way to achieve goals on the spot. It can be hard to know where to start, especially when it comes to finding the best approach. The ability to think quickly and remain strategic in one’s approach can be helpful in persuading an audience and having a greater impact. It’s important to consider the context and end goals in order to determine which method best fits the individual, as well as how effective it is over time.. However, there is also the risk that if we do not know our subject matter well enough, the speech can go off the rails and lead to results that are less than ideal.

On the other hand, following a script can be very helpful for a number of situations. 
Self-improvement is an important and necessary part of life. A great example of this would be a public speaker. It can help you think on your feet and allow you to be more creative in your approach and better adjust to unpredictable situations. 

In conclusion, both improvisation and following a script can be valuable and helpful tools when pursuing self-improvement. While there is no one-size-fits all answer, two of the most popular methods are improvisation and following a script when trying to be someone. Of course, with this method, there is the risk of becoming overly reliant on a script and becoming dependent on it, leading to a lack of creative thinking. These two methods have their own set of benefits and drawbacks, and understanding them can help us decide which is best for our own individual needs. This can be especially beneficial in contexts such as business or entrepreneuring, as if the individual is properly prepared, this can allow them to better anticipate obstacles and make better decisions in the long run. When someone is stuck in a rut, or trying something entirely new, following a step-by-step process can help them establish a foundation and develop their skills over time",1
"Even when someone's thoughts on a subject are initially negative, it is possible to change them through open discussion and open- mindedness. 
First impressions are powerful and have a lasting effect: they can shape opinions and perceptions, and are especially difficult to change. Therefore, even when a first impression is impossible to change, there is potential for it to be turned into a more positive outlook.. For example, if a person has a preconceived notion about a particular restaurant's cuisine, providing a positive or enlightening experience allows for a shift in their opinion. Moreover, it can be extremely difficult to shift this initial opinion, as firmly crafted perceptions are hard to move from one extreme to the other. Studies have found that overall, first impressions tend to be positive, yet there can be exceptions where they are determined to be negative",1
"Ultimately, it takes a degree of strength and resilience to work towards keeping from being overwhelmed. . Likewise, when a workplace problem arises, we may respond with a problem-solving attitude or remain stuck in the despair. 
We have the power to choose our own character traits, which gives us the ability to decide how something that happens to us affects us. For example, when faced with a material loss, we may choose to face the challenge with resilience and positivity or give up and be consumed by the negative emotions. In these cases, our emotions can become overwhelming, and our go-to strategies for managing our feelings may fail to provide the necessary support. 

However, it can be exceptionally difficult to keep things from affect us when they are related to family and other matters that are deeply important to us. Similarly, we can choose how we respond to a situation where someone loses control of their emotions; we can be understanding and patient, or react harshly",1

When researching everyday life in Puerto Rico, El Salvador, and the United States, it is important to take into consideration the various customs, family dynamics, clothing, education, and discipline methods in each place. 

Comparisons like this can help one reflect on their outlook on life and their place in the world. Life in different countries can offer insight into new ways of thinking and looking at the world, expanding one's horizons and experiences. In Puerto Rico and El Salvador, family is typically very central to life, while in the United States, families may have more distance between them. Generally, food in the United States is more processed and convenience-based than in Puerto Rico and El Salvador, where traditional, made-from-scratch, home-cooked meals are more common. Discipline also varies, with stricter structures in El Salvador and Puerto Rico, and more relaxed attitudes in the United States. Clothing in Puerto Rico ranges from everyday casual to formal, with a focus on traditional dress for special occasions, whereas in El Salvador clothing is more casual and the focus is more on practicality. Educational values vary, as in Puerto Rico, families often prioritize education for their children, while in El Salvador, the focus is more on growing up quickly and with minimal schooling",1
"
In recent years, the debate between home schooling versus attending a traditional school has become increasingly prevalent. 

Although both traditional school and home schooling have their advantages, those who opt for home schooling are able to take advantage of more individualized and flexible instruction. Home schooling allows learners the freedom to customize their own unique learning experience and create a more personalized educational setting.. Home schooling allows parents to build a lesson plan that caters to not only their child's strengths, but also focuses on areas that their child needs help with. While in traditional school classrooms, teachers are limited to an average set pace that does not cater to students with different learning styles. However, home schooling allows students to slow down and take their time in understanding a concept or to skip ahead if they already possess any prior knowledge. 

Another major benefit of home schooling is the freedom for learners to work at their own pace. Home schooling gives students the freedom to decide when and where they want to work, making it easier for them to choose hands-on and out-of-the-classroom activities. Parents who choose this option are able to tailor their children's curriculum to fit their individual needs and abilities. Additionally, home schooling allows parents to accommodate their children's unique interests and provide advanced instruction in topics of their interest. Both methods of education have their own unique advantages, and choosing which one is right for your specific situation can be a difficult decision. 

Finally, home schooling provides learners with a more flexible schedule and the option to structure learning around other activities. So, what exactly are the benefits of home schooling when compared to traditional schooling?

One of the most obvious benefits of home schooling is customization",1
"To prevent this, we should act thoughtfully and patiently to ensure our best efforts are taken towards reaching our goals.

For example, let's consider planning for a successful business venture. When we take the time to ensure everything is completed correctly and to the best of our abilities, it is much more likely that we will succeed in the long run. We may need to take the time to ensure our web hosting and security are up to scratch in order to guarantee the safety and satisfaction of our customers.

Patience and accuracy are essential to achieving our goals. 
The key to achieving our goals is to develop patience. If we rush through the process of researching potential investments or launching a product, we may make mistakes that will cost us money in the future. If we act too quickly or without proper consideration, we are likely to make mistakes and take the wrong course of action, which can be detrimental in the long run. Therefore, developing patience and mastering the skill of ""working smarter, not harder"" is a crucial part of setting and obtaining our goals.. Even something like setting up a website can require patience. As the old saying goes, haste makes waste",1
"Not only did they learn the importance of these virtues, they also experienced a sense of accomplishment and earned the satisfaction and joy of creating something they could all be proud of.. The task: to create a mural together, illustrating the importance of patience, creativity, and focus. As the days passed and the mural started to take shape, I could see the joy they got from seeing how they each lent their own unique contributions.

Rendered in bright colors, the mural depicted our class standing in a variety of poses and positions. 
My elementary school students were excited when I unveiled my art project to them. All their hard work, painstaking focus, and creativity paid off when the mural was finally completed—the result was a stunning artwork that filled everyone with immense pride.

The art project highlighted to the students how patience, creativity, and focus are essential to achieve amazing results. I could see the determination to complete it properly on their faces.

"During an interview, candidates should highlight their unique strengths and explain how their ambition and eagerness to learn can be an advantage. Those who lack experience have fewer preconceived notions about the job and can bring fresh perspectives to challenges. 
An employer's decision to hire a candidate is based on many components, one of which is experience. Therefore, it is important for employers to holistically assess each candidate's skillset to determine who would be the best fit for the job.. 

Aspiring employees who have limited or no experience can succeed by demonstrating their hard work, diligent study, and dedication to the job. Additionally, they can be trained more quickly and cost-effectively. Moreover, having them focus on the skills and characteristics that can be acquired through the job itself can help potential employers to accurately assess them for the role.

Nevertheless, should an employer incorrectly judge potential employees based on experience alone, it could lead to hiring the wrong candidate. While having extensive experience can often make an individual a top pick for a job opening, employers also benefit from considering applicants who have little to no experience",1
"While imagination can be important in coming up with creative ideas, knowledge is the essential ingredient in taking action on those ideas. Knowledge is thus a fundamental tool for growth and success.

In the end, we can see why knowledge is more important than imagination. 
Knowledge is often referred to as the key to success, and it’s true – knowledge can open many doors, giving us access to unique opportunities in life. It is knowledge that allows us to make decisions, solve complex problems and develop plans of action.

Imagination allows us to visualize possibilities and dream up creative solutions to problems, but this is only the first half of success. Imagination is essential to giving us the ideas and visions that can shape our lives, but it is knowledge that gives us the capacity to carry out those ideas. Thus, without knowledge, our dreams will remain just that – dreams. We need knowledge to make our dreams a reality. Knowledge can help us to create strategies for navigating the complexity of the world around us, keeping us one step ahead of our competitors and giving us an edge in our respective industries. Only when combined with knowledge can our ideas become reality.. Knowledge of the world around us and the various systems at work in society gives us the power to turn creative ideas into tangible plans of action.

The ability to effectively utilize knowledge also gives us the capacity to identify risks and think ahead",1
"Asking for advice can also be cost-effective when compared to the possible costs of making the wrong decision. Receiving an outside opinion or perspective can help individuals make informed decisions and can even result in a higher success rate. A lack of discussion means a lack of different perspectives, which can lead to a less than optimal decision. 

In conclusion, while asking for advice is not always necessary, it is a valuable tool with a wide range of benefits to consider when making life decisions. It can provide cost savings, help provide a more complete view of the situation, and even potentially raise success rate outcomes.. Furthermore, not asking for advice can also be detrimental to helpful relationships with others in certain situations. 

Nevertheless, it is also important to consider the drawbacks of not wanting or seeking advice from another when in need of assistance. 
When faced with a difficult decision in life, it is often beneficial to ask for advice from others",1
"

This type of program should benefit students from primary school to university level. 
Intergenerational educational programs are a great way for both young and old students to come together and learn from one another while also helping each other. University students can gain valuable insight and access resources from experienced colleagues as mentors. It also gives children and teens the opportunity to learn from experienced adults, and adults the chance to stay informed on technological developments. Moreover, these programs give students a platform to understand the different perspectives, beliefs, and values of the older and younger generations. Teacher facilitated co-learning settings can help kids build connections that will help them succeed and grow in the long-term. Everyone benefits and leaves with a more nuanced understanding of the world, and how generations work together to create and learn.. This type of program is important in order to bridge the gap between the generations, build understanding, and foster collaboration",1
"Perhaps the biggest pro is the potential to gain invaluable experience early on. Being aware of both the potential pros and cons can help young people make informed decisions.. Furthermore, trying to balance school work and a job can be challenging, leading to a lack of sleep or burnout. On top of that, a young person may face age-related discrimination in the workplace, making it difficult to get ahead. 

However, there are also some potential cons to consider when committing to a job at a young age. In addition, a job can provide a young person with some financial stability to pay for college tuition or other expenses. Having an opportunity to quickly build up knowledge and skills while still in school can give the young person a competitive advantage in the job market. 

In the end, deciding whether or not to commit to a job at a young age is an individual decision that needs to be carefully weighed. For example, the rigid schedule of a full-time job may limit a young person’s ability to pursue other interests or activities such as volunteering, internships, and hobbies. 
There is no doubt that deciding to commit to a job at a young age can bring many advantages",1
"This rapid path to graduation enables students to save time, money, and graduate earlier than if they had followed the traditional four-year graduation path. This could be especially advantageous for students who are paying their tuition on their own, or who have already found a career path and would like to pursue it as soon as possible. Additionally, it could create a situation of overcrowding in certain college courses due to the larger number of students taking the same course in one given semester. With less time to experiment with courses, students may end up deciding on an academic path ahead of time without the possibility of changing their mind. Therefore, it is important to weigh the pros and cons before deciding if this program is suitable for each individual student.. Additionally, the three-year program could make it harder for students to receive aid from scholarships and grants. 

The three-year graduation program offered by Generic_School certainly has a number of pros and cons, and can have considerable impacts on student body. But what are the pros and cons of such a program? And how does it affect the broader student body? 

The primary advantage of the three-year graduation program is that it can enable certain students to save money, time, and graduate earlier than usual. By compressing the traditional four years into three, students can take the same courses to obtain a degree, but faster. This rapid-path to graduation may also easier for students to feel overwhelmed by the amount of coursework they need to complete in a compressed time-frame.

When it comes to its impact on the broader student body, the three-year graduation program could create a situation of inequity between those who can and cannot take advantage of the program. 

However, this program could also have some downsides that must be considered. 
In recent years, Generic_School has begun offering a three-year graduation program to its students",1
"Despite this, it is a view that some people may disagree with, believing that it is better to take a more cautious approach in order to avoid making errors.

However, it is important to understand that mistakes can be a part of the successes that people achieve. 
Making mistakes is an often unfortunate, but essential, part of life. For example, by understanding the consequences of our errors, we gain new skills and knowledge for future tasks and can use this to improve our performance over time. Contrary to the popular belief that mistakes are an embarrassing and negative part of life, mistakes should be seen as an opportunity to grow and develop. Similarly, when mistakes are made in our personal or professional lives, we can use them as a learning experience and implement better ways of working. Mistakes can be used as a learning tool, helping to shape our growth and development as we strive for success. We should acknowledge that mistakes are simply part of the process and use them to fuel our motivation to succeed. Despite our best intentions, mistakes are inevitable and can actually offer benefits. Through experimentation and risk-taking, we can gain a better understanding of what we need to do to get ahead. Through taking a holistic view of our mistakes and learning how to use them to our advantage, mistakes may in fact be the key to unlocking our potential for success.. 

Ultimately, committing mistakes in life can be beneficial if done in the right way",1

Fortunately, there are ways which educators can accommodate different types of learners. Overall, both distance learning and in-person classes have their share of advantages and disadvantages, and in order to find the best option for any particular student, it’s important to carefully consider the available options.. 
    Distance learning has been gaining traction in recent years as an alternative to traditional in-person classes for students. One of the primary downsides is the lack of the social aspect of traditional schooling, which can lead to increased stress levels and a lack of motivation for many students. While distance learning certainly has its advantages, such as the ability to learn from the comfort of home and increased flexibility with time management, there are also disadvantages which inevitably come with it. Furthermore, introducing more interactive elements such as small-group presentations could help reduce the stress of distance learning and help motivate students to stay committed to their courses. For instance, breaking up lectures with virtual online “room” discussions is an effective way to promote collaboration and communication between students",1
"Emerson’s idea of self-reliance provides foundation for anyone to stay steadfast and committed to their path and personal growth.. In an era of 24/7 connectivity and distractions, it is harder than ever to stay focused and determined when trying something new or mastering a skill. It encourages us to take ownership of our own development, symbolically “take the helm” of our own lives, and stay the course of relentless self-improvement. In today’s world, Emerson’s philosophy is just as relevant as ever. 
Ralph Waldo Emerson was an American philosopher renowned for his writings on individualism and self-reliance. He believed that personal growth and development could only take place when individuals take responsibility for their own lives and eschew conformity to societal norms. This philosophy can be applied to mastering any skill or trying something new",1

However, working in a group can also be a challenge. Team dynamics and disharmony can impede the progress of the task or project. One benefit of working in a group is that it allows multiple perspectives and ideas to be discussed, compared, and explored. Having peers to motivate and support each other can also be beneficial to the progress of a project or task. With a variety of different ideas being discussed, more comprehensive solutions can be developed. 
Working in a group has many advantages compared to working alone. It can also be hard to remain focused when others are discussing topics unrelated to the task at hand. Additionally, everyone is often expected to contribute in a group setting, while working alone can allow an individual to work at their own pace or within a comfortable space. For example, if one person is stuck on a certain task, their peers can help them brainstorm and come up with a solution. However, if support or advice is necessary, it can be difficult to obtain when working alone.. Working alone can help to prevent this distraction",1
"Acknowledging and celebrating individual successes can help build a student's sense of worth and self-esteem. 

I recall my own experiences of building self-confidence and self-esteem during my teenage years. 
One important way to build self-confidence and self-esteem for students is to identify and focus on their strengths. Achieving personal goals and milestones was a big part of what helped me develop a positive attitude towards myself and take pride in my accomplishments. Reaching a goal can not only improve our skill set but also can provide us with an increased sense of accomplishment and the ability to build self-confidence.. I believe that accomplishments are meaningful experiences which help us grow and develop our own self-esteem. Teachers can play an important role in helping students build self-confidence and self-esteem by providing support, encouragement, and positive feedback. When students are aware of and take pride in their accomplishments, they are likely to become more self-confident and have higher self-esteem",1
"I struggled to find motivation to finish my assignments and often faced the consequences of not turning them in on time. Furthermore, by working collaboratively with others on the same material, I would have gained a deeper understanding of the material and, in turn, a better grade.

In addition to improving student performance, joining a homework club can help students sharpen their communication skills. Working with a group of other students in an after-school homework club would have been a great advantage for me.

Having peers around to help each other with difficult assignments, ask questions, and provide support would have made it easier for me to not only finish my assignments on time, but even to finish them early. 
When I was in high school, I had a difficult time staying on top of my homework. It teaches students to work together, reach compromises with other people’s ideas, and better articulate and defend their own thoughts and opinions. It can ease the burden of completing assignments and provide an encouraging and helpful environment that can facilitate learning and collaboration.. Working on projects together to finish assignments can help students learn how to cooperate socially and academically.

In conclusion, an after-school homework club is a great resource for students looking to improve their grades, deepen their understanding of the material, and sharpen their communication skills",1

Overall, we cannot deny the advantages of cell phone use in school, but we should also recognize the potential risks if left unmanaged. 
Cell phones have become an integral part of our daily lives, with an ever-increasing penetration in our schools. It is also important to consider making resources available for students to learn proper internet safety, and for teachers to understand and accommodate the devices' use in the classroom. By studying how to effectively manage the use of cell phones in an educational setting, and by implementing appropriate policies, we can ensure a safe and responsible learning environment for our students.. These solutions are a way to create a balance between the potential misuse of cell phones in school, and their potential benefits as learning tools. On the other hand, the use of cell phones in school can be distracting to students, and their misuse can result in cheating on exams and cyberbullying. On one hand, cell phones offer conveniences such as access to online resources, and can be used for educational tools such as apps, as well as an outlet for reporting instances of bullying or abuse. An alternate approach could be to allow the use of cell phones under teacher supervision, emphasizing the importance of appropriate usage in the classroom as a digital literacy skill and through the use of classroom policies. Banning cell phones completely might be too extreme if the main concern is misuse, as confiscating them away from students would not hold oneself accountable to foster responsible behaviors. 

The debate on allowing cell phones in school should consider the respective pros and cons, as well as the potential solutions to effectively manage the devices' use in an educational setting. 

The prevalence of cell phones in school also gives rise to the use of alternative solutions, such as filtering applications and messaging services that limit distractions and inappropriate media access",1

Through my own experiences and the research out there, it’s clear that singing is a powerful tool that can help to boost one’s mood and relieve stress. My ability to express myself through song has also helped me to better navigate difficult feelings or times of sadness. Whether it is singing alone or with a group, it’s a great way to engage in some self-care.. According to a study published in the journal “Frontiers in Neuroscience,” singing was found to reduce anxiety levels and regulation of the hormonal cortisol, which is the stress hormone. For many people, it is a form of expression, a way to connect with their emotions and feelings, and a way to feel comforted. Additionally, it was found that singing can increase pleasant emotions and feelings while decreasing unpleasant feelings. 
Singing has long been known to bring joy to those who partake in it. From a personal standpoint, singing brings me a sense of calm and tranquility, especially when I'm feeling stressed or overwhelmed. 

When it comes to the research, it appears that singing is a great way to increase feelings of happiness and reduce stress",1
"Factors such as the age of the students and the quality of instruction being provided, as well as the availability of resources and support structures, must all be taken into account. On the other hand, the additional hours spent in the classroom could be seen as an unnecessary burden, with student wellbeing and learning outcomes suffering due to fatigue and boredom. Ultimately, the decision to extend the school day should be made with the interests of students at heart.. 
Extending the school day has been a hot topic of debate in many countries for a variety of reasons. In order to more fully understand the potential implications of such a change, it is essential to consider the educational context in which this decision would be made. On the one hand, some research suggests that by adding two hours to the school day, students could be exposed to a greater variety of topics while engaged in directed learning, and would have more time to explore their individual interests",1
"
Proponents of allowing students to bring their phones to school argue that phones offer a number of educational benefits such as access to educational apps, online resources, and digital work collaboration. It can be a major distraction for students, detracting from their focus on academics. In addition, the use of phones in school can act as a safety measure, as having a phone on them gives students the ability to easily contact parents and guardians in case of an emergency.

On the other hand, there are certain drawbacks to allowing students to use their phones in school. Furthermore, it is possible that allowing phones in school unfairly gives an advantage to students who can afford the latest technology, potentially creating a digital divide.. It may also lead to potential cyberbullying in school as well as encourage cheating",1
"Examples of successful students who have committed to a career at a young age include Bill Gates, who dropped out of college to start Microsoft, and Steve Jobs, who dropped out of college shortly after enrolling to pursue his entrepreneurial endeavors. 
Committing to a career at a young age can come with a host of advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, parents and society can encourage and influence career-focused decision making, helping to steer young students in the right direction career-wise. The Board of Teachers at a private school recognize the potential advantages of committing to a career at a young age, such as having a clearer focus on education and career goals, as well as having more time to work towards professional excellence, enabling a potentially smoother transition into the job market. This can open up opportunities for success and growth, but can also bring about struggles such as increased stress impacts on personal health and relationships. Both of these tech pioneers have gone to become world-renowned innovators and successes.",1
"By collaborating together, group members can share ideas, thoughts, and resources to create more comprehensive and creative solutions that may be less achievable individually. Furthermore, group members are often more motivated and energized to work together, making the task more enjoyable than working alone. Working in a group can also include bouncing ideas off one another so members can identify any potential issues and provide helpful feedback and direction. 
Working in a group can be more advantageous than working alone in many ways. Lastly, shared accountability ensures that tasks are completed in a timely and effective manner, leading to better results than what could be achieved alone.",1

One of the most significant benefits of participating in extracurricular activities is the growth and development of the skills and talents necessary for further success in life. Such activities can help students find new ways to channel their energy and develop talents or skills in a positive direction. While extracurricular activities can be a source of development and enrichment, the associated time and effort require a certain level of commitment from students, meticulous planning, and sacrifices regarding leisure and sleep amongst others.. For instance, by committing to structured extracurricular activities, students are less likely to engage in activities that could lead to trouble or harm. Additionally, engaging in extracurricular activities may provide invaluable socialization opportunities and help expand a student’s capacity to engage with others from diverse backgrounds.

Furthermore, participating in extracurricular activities can prove important to avoiding and getting out of trouble. Taking part in extracurriculars can also mitigate the risk of getting involved with unsafe peers or environments.

It's essential to review and consider the pros and cons of extracurricular activities before committing",1
"Through zoos, Disney parks, and travelling to different states and countries, one can explore the world and enjoy the beauty of the natural world.. 

However, beyond having fun and entertainment, spending time outdoors with family or by oneself can bring a sense of peace, relaxation, and joy. There are many enjoyable activities that can bring joy, stimulation, and relaxation if done outside. Travelling to other states or countries can also bring one to a land of beauty, cultural newness, and a different way of life. Disney parks can also be a great place to get outside and explore thrilling rides, delicious food, and unique characters. Walking through a park, swimming in a lake, or simply lying in the grass can be a great way to destress, and give one a newfound sense of clarity and happiness. Zoos, Disney parks, and travelling to different states or countries are exciting ways to get outdoors and explore the world. 
Spending time outdoors is an important part of life, for family and for oneself. One can observe the natural beauty of the world, get some exercise, and enjoy the company of others. 

Going to a zoo can be an enjoyable experience, especially when one can get up close to animals that wouldn't otherwise be accessible.

People often seek outside guidance when making major decisions or dealing with life's problems. Every day, individuals must make decisions based on their own feelings, desires, and experiences. Looking to experts for direction can be beneficial for seeking more information or understanding a complex topic, but it should not take away from the individual's right to make their own informed decisions.

Rather than turning to outside advice, people should trust their own intuition. Utilizing one's own agency to make decisions—good or bad—can provide valuable insight and helpful information for the future.

In addition, depending on expert advice can lead to a false sense of security. Ultimately, while expert advice can be a useful tool, it should never be a substitute for an individual's instinct and perspective. However, it is not necessary to rely on expert advice for important life matters. People may take the words of experts too seriously or too literally, causing them to overlook their own individual values and rely too heavily on another's opinion. Some of the most important lessons learned throughout life come from the individual's own judgments and decisions. This can be a difficult concept to embrace, especially when considering major changes in life, but ultimately it can lead to long-term personal growth",1
"Furthermore, techniques such as hands-on learning and real-world application are utilized and can help students find practical solutions to their problems. 
Excerpt: Online classes have become increasingly popular, offering students the option to study from home instead of attending school in person. 

In conclusion, when deciding between online and in-person classes, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. First of all, the student has more flexibility when it comes to their studies since they can set their own schedule for when they do their work. On the other hand, the lack of social interaction and the dependence on self-motivation can be drawbacks for students who are used to attending classes in-person. Furthermore, online courses may not have the same level of resources as a more traditional learning environment. They are able to form relationships with their peers and build social skills. There are advantages to both online and regular classes, and it depends on the individual student to determine which will be best for them. Each individual student needs to consider their own personal preferences and skills to decide which option best suits their needs.. However, this type of learning may also be stressful for some students, as they have to adjust to the pressures of attending classes in a traditional environment.

Studying online has its advantages as well. 

For students attending classes in-person, one great advantage is the social aspect. Additionally, students are not limited to their physical location as they can attend classes online from anywhere, making it easier for students who have limited access to physical classes",1
"This is especially true for tasks that need to be completed on a tight timeline. Lastly, it can be more efficient to work alone, since you have fewer obstacles to maneuver. You can explore different ideas without feeling constrained by other people's opinions. Firstly, working alone allows you to have greater control over the task you're tackling. 
The advantages of working alone compared to working with a group are numerous. For example, if you're working on an essay and only have one day to finish it, you'll likely work faster and more efficiently alone, rather than having to collaborate with a group.. You don't have to worry about incorporating another person's ideas or accommodating their wants and needs. Secondly, working alone gives you the freedom to be as creative as you'd like",1
"From instant messaging to video conferencing, people can easily communicate with their loved ones anytime and anywhere. From faster medical treatments to more efficient ways to communicate, technology has profoundly changed the way we live our lives..

"On the other hand, graduating early can also have negative effects. Additionally, there can be a risk of missing out on unique high school experiences like dances, sports, or summer activities, which could be regretful in the long run. Nevertheless, students should take the time to consider all of the potential pros and cons before deciding to pursue an early graduation.. It can mean that some classes were skipped due to an accelerated schedule, which could result in a lack of fundamental knowledge or critical skills. It can make it possible to take classes that weren’t available during traditional high school, and it could help students to become more independent and prepare for the responsibilities of adult life. On the positive side, graduating early might give students an extra jump start on their college education or future career.

Curfews are an important tool in helping teenagers develop responsibility and self-regulation. 

One of the primary benefits of implementing a curfew is that it increases safety. With a curfew in place, teens are discouraged from participating in risky activities such as taking part in criminal activities or driving with no license. 

Overall, curfews can help provide teens with the structure and guidance they need to stay safe and healthy. Additionally, parents can be sure that their teens are in a safe place, and not in an environment where they are vulnerable to potential harm.

Another benefit of curfews for teenagers is that it can help build better relationships with their family. By implementing a curfew, families can build better relationships and teenagers can gain a better understanding of responsibility.. By enforcing a curfew, teens are given structure and their parents can be reassured that their children are safe. By setting a curfew for teens, parents can ensure their child's safety, help foster better relationships, and give them a healthy lifestyle. It can help give parents peace of mind and keep teens away from risky behaviors and environments. This can encourage communication and dialogue between families and help foster a strong bond between parents and their children",1
"Additionally, students often get to spend more quality time with their families during this break. On the one hand, a long break can provide students with the opportunity to review the material they learned during the school year and even take summer school classes to make up any credits they need. Additionally, lots of idle time during the summer may lead to students forgetting much of what they studied the previous year due to lack of practice. 
Summer break is a common and much anticipated time for students, but it could also have its drawbacks. Ultimately, it’s up to each student and their families to weigh the pros and cons of the different options and decide what solution best fits their particular needs and situation.. 

An alternative option to a long summer break would be to attend year-round school, which would provide students with a more consistent learning environment and prevent knowledge from fading over time. 

On the other hand, students who have difficulty with learning may struggle more without the regular schedule of school, and find it difficult to continue learning during their own time",1

"

Ultimately, the solution lies somewhere in between. On the other hand, great wisdom can come from heeding the words of those with expertise and experience, who may well have a better comprehension of the various variables at play in a decision-making process. 
Mankind has been debating the merits of self-determination versus trusting the advice of experts and authorities for centuries. On one hand, there is a strong argument for following one’s own instincts, taking personal responsibility, and not relinquishing control of life’s important matters to outside sources. Seeking input and guidance is beneficial, and empowering oneself with knowledge and facts is invaluable, but the decision will always ultimately come down to the individual. Being informed and aware of the consequences of their choice, taking a moment to consider their gut instinct, and then making a decision based on what is most important to them is the best course of action.. After all, it is impossible for an outside authority to truly understand an individual’s situation or what they value the most",1

It allows one to better understand themselves and their goals in life, while ensuring that they create goals only for themselves, not for external approval. 

To continue on my journey of self-reflection and autonomy, I am creating a plan to focus on self-growth and finding what makes me happiest and using that as the foundation for making my own choices. 
Throughout my life, I've worked to find my own personal identity. Being an individual reminds me of the power I have to make my own decisions and I believe that this will help me become a better person than I was previously.. From my experiences in discovering my own identity, I understand now that there can be immense value in finding autonomy and becoming an individual. This plan includes setting achievable goals that place the value of my own opinion and well-being first.

"It has improved our lifestyle, supported knowledge, and had a major impact on our economy. From the development of modern medicine, to providing an easier means of communication and transportation, technology has significantly changed our lifestyle for the better. The internet has made it easier than ever before to access information from across the globe, allowing students and researchers to broaden their understanding and learn from the collective knowledge of our species.

Last but not least, technology has a major impact on our economy. For example, the use of automated machines for patient diagnostics, and surgical robots, has allowed for a more precise and detailed diagnosis compared to older traditional methods. With the advent of the internet, access to vast amounts of information is now literally at our fingertips. We can only imagine what the future holds in store for us with advancements in technology.. 

In conclusion, technology has had innumerable positive effects on humanity. With the use of technology, businesses no longer have to rely solely on manual labor for their operations. This, in turn, not only saves critical time and resources but also provides a better standard of care for patients worldwide.

Not only does technology improve our lifestyle, but it also supports knowledge and education. Automation has allowed businesses to increase their productivity and efficiency in an incredibly cost-effective manner, and the use of technology has had a major impact on how we conduct business on a global scale.

"Unfortunately, this has had dire consequences more than once, leading to tragic consequences and lost opportunities.

Today, technology has made it easier than ever to live an idle lifestyle. However, the flip side of this mentality has been the risk of becoming too passive and idle in our society.  So let us take his words as a reminder to stay active and seize the day so that we can create a better future and leave behind a lasting legacy.. Taking Thomas Jefferson’s words to heart, we must not be afraid to invest our time and energy into something today rather than waiting until tomorrow. From Thomas Jefferson's famous maxim that encouraged citizens to ""never put off until tomorrow that which you can do today,"" an active and industrious spirit has been fundamental to our success. 
Throughout American history, the push for active thought and behavior has been a key factor in our nation's progress. We can use our devices to make our lives easier and put off taking action until tomorrow, or even until next week. But if history has taught us anything, it's that idle behavior comes with a price. From everyday people to entire nations, an idle lifestyle can often lead to stagnation, which often leads to missed opportunities and, in some cases, a complete reversal of fortune.

In order to avoid a similar fate and ensure a prosperous future, active behavior must remain at the forefront of our minds. Such a mindset will not only help us reach our individual goals more efficiently but will also benefit the country as a whole",1

To try and change a person's first impression, it is important to be aware of the situation before you enter and to take cues from the environment. Active listening, being present in the conversation, and cultivating genuine interest from your conversation partner are all great ways to make an effort in shifting the impression of yourself. 
First impressions are incredibly important, as they can shape the way a person thinks about you and your reputation for potentially long lasting effects. 

Ultimately, it is clear that your initial impression on another person can have a lasting effect. Making a strong first impression is the key to fostering subsequent relationships, as making a bad impression can be difficult to change. People often have a hard time altering their personal opinion of someone after a single encounter, as they are driven by emotions and memories that can be difficult to overcome. This is why it is so important to give off the right impression, as it can have far reaching impacts on forming relationships, establishing your reputation, and helping you work towards achieving your goals.. Additionally, following up after a meeting and striving to improve the relationship over time can help in changing someone’s initial impression of you",1
"By engaging in partnerships, learning is simultaneously enhanced and improved.. 
Partnership is an integral part of any learning experience. When working with a partner, it is also possible to get “second opinions” and different viewpoints on a particular topic or subject. This approach is especially effective in the classroom setting, where students can work together to gain a better understanding of the material. Furthermore, having multiple people in a learning environment allows for a more efficient distribution of work, enabling learners to go further and more in-depth. Working together to achieve a common goal allows individuals to discuss and debate ideas as well as collaboratively problem solve. Working in groups also encourages everyone to engage more actively with their learning, opening up the possibility for further exploration and learning. It is through this exchange of ideas and input that learning can be deepened and strengthened. When working in groups, each member can bring something unique to the situation and work together to form a bigger picture of the topic",1
"Additionally, it is important to demonstrate passion for the topic; this will help motivate the students and can help make learning more fun. Finally, be conscious of the different interests of the younger students when setting the learning objectives; this will help them stay engaged and will also ensure that everyone in the classroom can learn the material.. Creative methods, such as using games, stories, and visuals, can help keep young students engaged and can also help explain difficult topics. 
When teaching in a classroom where both younger and older students are present, it is important to remember that each student has different learning needs. When introducing a new topic, present it in a way that is age-appropriate to all students in the class",1
"
The debate of whether or not to allow students to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times has been an ongoing one. Schools should consider instituting rules to ensure that phones are not used during class, as the primary focus should always be on learning. Furthermore, phones can provide essential tools to students such as calendars, note-taking apps, and calculators. . Additionally, schools should ensure that students are aware of the risks and consequences associated with phone usage, so that students can make more informed decisions. 

Ultimately, if smartphones are to be allowed in school, strict guidelines should be put into place. On one side of the argument, proponents believe that smartphones can provide students with an unprecedented level of connectivity, enabling them to stay in touch with friends, research school topics, and access other important information. Furthermore, parents might worry that phone usage may lead to increased cyberbullying or exposure to inappropriate content. 

On the other hand, detractors believe that enabling students to use phones during lunch periods and free times can be a distraction and counter to proper learning",1

Introduction: 
For many students, the idea of committing to a career can seem daunting and intimidating. However, in today's ever-changing and competitive job market, committing to a career at a young age can be beneficial in more than one way. In this essay, we will discuss the pros and cons of students starting their career at a young age, provide examples to illustrate the advantages of deciding on a career early, and explain why some people may disagree with decisions to embark on a career in high school",1
"Come up with possible solutions to problems you may encounter and develop a strategy to help you combat them. 
Once you have researched how to gain confidence in order to change a first impression, it is important to look within yourself and reach a clear vision of how you would like to be perceived; this will serve as the bedrock for your journey. What steps are necessary to help you work hard to reach your desired goal? However, it is also important to identify the potential challenges one may face when attempting to change a first impression. After reaching this point, it is time to formulate a plan of action. Finally, activities like JROTC can act as an excellent opportunity to gain the necessary skills to create a successful plan and therefore make the necessary changes to how you are initially perceived.",1
"
Learning from other people's experiences can be an invaluable resource. We can pick the brains of people who have gone before us, build relationships, and grow together. Whether it's hearing stories about someone's successes or struggling with their own journey, taking time to listen to and learn from someone else's experiences is often the best way to make sure we don't make the same mistakes. Hearing stories about others’ successes and failures can make us more informed and get us better prepared for our own journey through life. In this way, learning from other people's experiences can be a powerful tool for personal and collective growth.. We can study their approaches, their successes and their failures, and use that knowledge to our advantage. We learn from the past, but more importantly, we build for the future. Knowing someone else's challenges and their solutions ahead of time can help us steer clear of potential pitfalls. 

In short, learning from other people's experiences is an indispensable tool for achieving a better life. When we help others out, we create bonds that can last a lifetime. 

On a larger scale, learning from other's experiences can help us understand the nature of reality better and put us in a better position to make more informed decisions. 

Moreover, learning from other people's experiences allows us to develop connections with others by building relationships and sharing ideas. By gaining insights from those who have gone before us, we can become more prepared for our own experiences",1
"Asking different people for their thoughts and beliefs will not only give you a wider range of perspectives, it can also help to build relationships and encourage communication between them. It provides variety of thoughts and possible insight that can be incredibly valuable when making a decision.. 

For instance, when considering major life decisions such as which college to attend or which career path to pursue, one should consider talking to not only family and friends, but to counselors, mentors and teachers. 
Gathering multiple opinions before making a decision is a valuable practice that can be of great benefit for a variety of reasons. Attorneys who are knowledgeable in the field can provide useful information on the legal implications of the decision, while financial advisors can advise whether or not a certain investment is a wise choice.

In addition, obtaining different opinions from those in the industry or who are knowledgeable in the matter being decided on will give an even broader perspective. It's important to do research and gather as much information as possible by looking at the pros and cons of each option in order to make the best choice for yourself.

Similarly, when forming business plans or deciding on investments, it is beneficial to get input from professional colleagues such as accountants, attorneys or financial advisors in addition to opinions from family and friends. For example, when deciding which type of marketing to employ, opinions from marketing experts may be beneficial as well as getting input from those with experience in the company.

Gathering multiple perspectives before making a major decision is key to making the right choice and can lead to the best outcome for everyone involved",1
"
Attitude is often described as “the lens through which we view the world.” Indeed, having a positive attitude can significantly improve our daily lives, from the way we approach the workplace to the way we handle relationships. A positive attitude can show employers and colleagues the state of our mental health and resilience towards challenges, making it easier for us to take the steps towards a brighter future.. With resilience and conviction, any individual can develop the necessary skills and knowledge to become successful, but it is the attitude that makes them shine. It is no wonder that so many prominent figures throughout history have highlighted the importance of developing a positive outlook—including Benjamin Franklin, who famously said, “The Constitution only guarantees the American people the right to pursue happiness. For example, a study from the University of Michigan showed that students with a positive attitude about taking a tough math course achieved better results than students with negative attitudes, regardless of their level of intelligence or King’s College London tested the effect of “positive thinking” on athletes and found that successfully imagining the act of completing a task can increase motivation.

In our professional and personal lives, having a positive attitude can open the doors of opportunity. This is because positive thinking leads to optimism, which can improve quality of work, thus making us more appealing to employers or allowing us to achieve our goals. You have to catch it yourself.” 

What makes a positive attitude the key to success is its role in personal motivation. 

Positive attitude is undoubtedly a key to success",1
"We believe that fostering these kinds of supportive relationships can have a positive impact on both student’s school experiences.. 
At our school, we have developed a mentorship program that pairs older students with younger ones. Through this program, older students can help younger students get situated for the school year, helping them identify their classes and assisting them in completing their assignments. This program provides a great opportunity for older students to develop their leadership skills, while the younger students benefit from the support and guidance of their peers",1
"When implementing a homework club, it is important to remember the potential feelings and emotions of students, and consider strategies to make such activities engaging and inviting. 
Starting a homework club in schools can be a beneficial experience for students, but it can also introduce a variety of challenges and emotions. It is important to consider all factors before starting a homework club in order to make sure that it is an effective and beneficial experience for all involved.. Advantages of organizing a homework club may include creating a space for students to catch up on work, encouraging academic support and providing a platform for further learning opportunities. Meanwhile, it may be difficult to get students motivated to stay after school, and it could create added pressure due to expectations set by parents and teachers. Additionally, it is important to remember the potential challenges that may arise, such as students feeling overwhelmed by academic pressures",1
"While we can observe and learn from the experiences of others, we must also embrace our own journey through life and make the most of it. It's ok to take ideas or lessons from their experiences, but in the end, we all have to create our own unique path.. As the saying goes, “you’ll never know till you try”. However, the experience won't be the exact same, since we haven't actually lived it first-hand. We can empathize with someone else's story, and feel similar emotions as them. While we can understand other people's life stories, we will never experience them in the same way. While the circumstances that brought us to this moment are different, they have shaped us and created the people we are today. 
No matter how hard we try, it is impossible for us to have the exact same life experiences that someone else has had. Every single one of us has our own individual path through life that gives us a unique perspective of the world around us. We may also observe and learn from the experiences of other people, and take what we learn and apply it in our own life. 

When it comes to living other people's experiences, the answer isn't a simple yes or no. We might have the same emotion from a similar situation, even if it didn't happen to us, but it's never going to be the exact same. 

Ultimately, we have to create our own life experiences and explore what this world has to offer",1
"Ultimately, Emerson taught us that learning and growth depend on our willingness to take risks and challenge ourselves.. To him, knowledge was found through experience rather than simply through books. He encouraged his readers to venture outside of their comfort zone and take risks, emphasizing that growth comes from doing things we are terrified of. 
Ralph Waldo Emerson, an influential philosopher and poet, believed that knowledge and understanding come through living boldly and fearlessly. By daring to venture out of the known, he suggested, we gain strength and understanding, leading to further pursuits full of richness and joy",1
"Accepting our failures, rather than dwelling on them, is key to success. Staying positive and understanding that the process of success is full of highs and lows is key to overcoming failure and finding success. On the other hand, when we taste success, we should value it and continue our good work, rather than using it as the only measure of our worth.

In order to make failure a positive experience, it’s important to stay motivated. We should learn from mistakes and view failure as an opportunity to learn and grow. Understanding that failure is part of the process can help us stay motivated and keep us from getting discouraged.

Finally, it is important to practice self-care when facing failure. 
Failure is an inevitable part of life. Failure can open up new opportunities to find success, build resilience, and gain valuable life lessons. It can be seen as both good and bad, but mainly depends on one's attitude towards it. It pushes us to stay positive, motivated, and determined, and to keep striving for the best. It pushes us to reflect on our mistakes and strive to make better decisions in the future. To quote Winston Churchill, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."" 

Failure can help us become better people. By viewing failure in this way, we can transform it from something that is bad into something that can ultimately lead to success.. It is normal to feel discouraged, but it is important to remember that setbacks are just temporary. Staying motivated, being positive, and learning from our mistakes are all important aspects of recovering from failure. 

To summarize, failure is not the end of the world - it's just a roadblock that we must overcome in order to find success. It encourages us to think about the cause of failure and how to overcome it and become more successful",1
"Students are not only taught the value of respect, but also receive an understanding of how to successfully navigate life with their own children and how to interact in meaningful ways with their parents. This is especially beneficial in preparing older students for parenting their own children and giving younger students the tools to better deal with their parents. Therefore, the program can provide crucial life-long guidance and knowledge to students that will prove to be invaluable long after graduation.. Upon examining the program more closely, the potential life long benefits that can be provided to students become evident. 
Through a study of the program's effects on both younger and older students, it has been found that introducing it into the classroom can help students of all ages learn the importance of respect, regardless of outward age",1
"People who are productive can experience many benefits, such as greater confidence, increased problem-solving skills, and a feeling of accomplishment. Overall, this quote serves as a gentle reminder to us all of how essential it is to stay active and productive.. We can use our experiences and knowledge to counsel and guide others to become successful. Being idle and not doing anything can have a huge negative impact on our lives. Productivity can also help us become stronger and more helpful to others. 
In this famous quote, Thomas Jefferson reminds us that being productive is incredibly important. We can miss out on opportunities and potential growth and development",1
"Examining the idea of positive self-belief and its ability to lead us to success is essential for self-betterment and growth.. To nurture positive self-belief, one must take on personal responsibilities in life in order to foster growth, both physically and mentally. Making mistakes which are often viewed negatively, can in fact be learning opportunities that can be utilized to make better decisions and better ourselves in the process. 
Self-belief is an integral part of success and is a building block to be able to strive forward and be successful. Being positive is crucial in building confidence and creating positive outcomes. Making good choices and being conscious of the consequences of the decisions that we make can be key in becoming successful",1
"
There are numerous factors that can influence an individual's level of accomplishment at work. Different individuals will have different levels of success depending on their individual skills and circumstances. Different perspectives can also be taken; while overall outcomes may be influenced by factors beyond an individual's control, there are also those factors which are under an individual's control and within their power to impact. These can range from personal aptitudes such as aptitude and attitude, to external forces like the job market and workplace dynamics. My conclusion is that it takes an effective combination of factors in and out of the individual's control to reach a high level of success. One must actively strive to embrace and optimise the elements that are in their control, while also taking into account external factors and their wider context.. It is important to consider that external factors such as the job market can often be out of the individual's control, yet still have an impact on their success",1

I am excited to take part in this business internship, job shadowing opportunity, or celebrity makeup role and look forward to exploring all that the company has to offer.. 
    After researching various business and makeup career opportunities, I believe that I have the necessary communication skills, talent, and ability to work with others to make a strong contribution to the host company",1
"People must be actively involved in the process of personal development. One of his most renowned quotes is, “Growth is the only evidence of life.” In this quote, Emerson explores the importance of growth in our lives. Growth, in its many forms, is essential to living a fulfilling life. By doing this, they will be more able to use the growth that they encounter to become the best version of themselves.. But more than just being a natural part of life, growth is also something that requires dedication and effort to attain. It can be seen through the physical, mental, and emotional changes that people experience throughout their life. 
Excerpt: 

Ralph Waldo Emerson is a renowned philosopher and poet whose works are still quoted today. Whether through intellectual pursuits, creative expression, or forging meaningful connections, people must seek out opportunities to grow and be open to the change that comes along with it",1
"Additionally, some people may struggle with depression or anxiety. 
We all have unique personalities and regardless of our similarities, our individual traits are what make us stand out. Stress, exhaustion, and feeling overwhelmed can all lead to a poor mood. People can have a bad day for a variety of reasons. Together, we can work to prevent snap judgments and build a strong foundation of mutual respect.. People can grow and change over time and they can choose to challenge their first impressions of one another and create deeper relationships. 

First impressions are not necessarily who a person is. Spend time getting to know the people you meet and take the time to understand them instead of judging them on a surface level. It's important to take the time to recognize the reasons why you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed, and tackle the issues head-on. It's important to give people the benefit of the doubt",1
"For example, digital tools can be used to facilitate learning outcomes, such as interactive online quizzes and games. Social media platforms can be used to post about upcoming physical activities, or for students to post pictures or videos of themselves participating in physical activities. For example, face-to-face interaction with teachers should not be replaced with online tutorials. 

Outside the classroom, technology can be used to promote physical activity. 
Technology has been increasingly used to supplement educational performance both in and out of the classroom. In addition, all technology use should be managed carefully and with appropriate safety precautions in place, such as parental consent forms for minors utilizing online learning technologies.. Technology can also help students become more engaged in their own learning, as they are able to take advantage of resources that may have otherwise been difficult to access. In the classroom, technology can be used to facilitate learning and to encourage students to take ownership of their learning. Technology should be used as an aid and supplement to learning, not as a replacement for traditional educational methods. 

In sum, technology can be used to enhance educational performance and promote physical activity for students. Wearables such as smartwatches can be used to track progress over time, motivating students to stay active and engaged with physical activity. However, it is important to ensure that technology is used in an appropriate manner in school environments",1
"This could encourage them to better manage their time, become more organized, and complete tasks more efficiently. It is important for administrators to keep in mind that an effective school day should provide students with a balance of academic and extracurricular activities, and should ensure that their physical and mental health are both taken into account.. Additionally, it could cause them to lose valuable time with friends and affect their social development.

Ultimately, the decision to adopt or reject a four-day, ten-hour school schedule should only be made after careful consideration of both its potential benefits and drawbacks. 
The debate over the potential pros and cons of switching to a four-day, ten-hour school week has been raging for some time. Proponents of this idea argue that it could provide students with more breaks and lighter homework loads, as well as giving them more time to explore and pursue activities beyond the classroom. Furthermore, the extended weekend could allow for good recreational activities and potentially more time spent with family.

On the flipside, the downside to a four-day, ten-hour school week may be that students will be required to attend school for a much longer period of time each day than usual. On the other hand, opponents of this concept worry that it could cause kids to experience fatigue and lack of focus due to the length of each day.

In terms of advantages, there is the potential for improved student productivity due to the shorter but longer school days. This could lead to feelings of exhaustion and could be particularly difficult for younger students who are already more susceptible to tiredness",1
"They can take the time to explain topics that may be difficult to understand. Further, they can help younger students assess their strengths and weaknesses, allowing them to understand what subjects they excel in and may need extracurricular assistance in. They can set a great example for the student body, demonstrating qualities such as respect and courtesy. These students can be mentors, helping to provide guidance when it comes to school and social matters. 
Older students within a school system have the opportunity to be extremely helpful to the younger generations coming up. From their experience, knowledge, and wisdom, they can provide support to those who are just starting out. Even the smallest action, such as smiling and nodding at a shy younger student in the hallway can go a long way. Through mentorship, guidance, and a positive role model, they can help create a healthier and more supportive school environment for years to come.. 

In the end, older students have the power to be an essential asset to the younger students in their school. 

Older students can also offer support in a more subtle way, by simply being a positive influence in the school",1
"Overall, these programs offer unique and valuable experiences for students in the form of educational support and personal development.. It is also an opportunity for students to develop confidence, resilience and self-sufficiency. Furthermore, these programs can be used as a space in which students can develop beneficial communication and problem-solving skills. 

When implemented appropriately, these types of school programs can be of great benefit to students in aiding academic achievement. 

On the other hand, there are some disadvantages to these programs, such as potential feelings of intimidation or jealousy for younger students in the presence of their older peers. By forming these mentor-mentee partnerships, younger students can receive assistance in areas like homework help, exam preparation and overcoming academic obstacles. Additionally, some students may be resistant when they have been placed in a mentor-mentee relationship with someone who is unfamiliar to them. 
School programs that pair older and younger students together can be an effective way of helping students in the areas of social adjustment, understanding new classes and forming better study habits. Benefits of these programs include helping younger students foster positive relationships with their peers, as well as providing guidance and mentorship through experienced upperclassmen",1
"With a policy in place, students will be able to converse and interact with their peers, and it would be easier for teachers to communicate with their students. Without proper funding and resources, this policy would be difficult to implement and monitor, since it would be hard for teachers to make sure that students are maintaining a healthy balance between work and leisure. 

On the other hand, what must also be considered is the cost of implementation. Furthermore, this policy could also have an effect on student behavior, since brief exchanges during meals or free time could easily disrupt classroom activities and even lead to disruptions in the learning environment. Additionally, the use of communication apps and online resources could be used by students to study and do research. By allowing this practice, schools could provide a sense of convenience for teachers, yet this policy could be accompanied with certain drawbacks.

On the plus side, letting students use their phones in school could be beneficial to both the students and teachers. While it could provide some convenience and benefits, it is important to make sure that the consequences of such a policy are taken into consideration as well.. 

Overall, it is important to weigh the advantages and disadvantages that come with allowing students to use their phones during lunch and free time in middle school. 
The idea of allowing students to use their phones during lunch and free time in middle school has been discussed among many educational professionals",1
"On the one hand, using a cell phone for educational purposes can be extremely beneficial, as students are able to more quickly access online resources such as textbooks and lesson plans. On the other hand, students may be tempted to use their phones for non-educational purposes, such as messaging friends or surfing the Internet. This can lead to them being distracted and not paying attention to the lessons, resulting in lower grades and a decrease in productivity. They can also use apps to help with their academic performance, by reinforcing the material they learned in class or connecting with peers and teachers to discuss difficult topics. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the school to set clear rules and regulations around the use of cell phones in the classroom, in order to ensure that students are able to take advantage of the positive benefits while also minimizing any potential negative consequences.. 
The presence of cell phones in the classroom can create both positive and negative consequences for students",1
"

In conclusion, it is essential to step outside the comfort zone and push our boundaries from time to time. 

As an example, take a person who is a professional web developer. Taking calculated risks helps individuals truly grow and become better versions of themselves.. 
In his wise words, Ralph Waldo Emerson aptley remarked that “Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.” It is true that we must put ourselves into positions of discomfort and challenge to be able to grow, both professionally as well as personally. With every new person they encounter, they are able to learn new perspectives and become better communicators. 

On a personal level, an individual might be scared to start a conversation with a stranger, for fear of being rejected or misunderstood. Growth necessitates venturing out of the comfort zone and pushing one's boundaries, so that we can be open to different ideas and inspired to make an impact. By taking small steps and actively engaging in new conversations, their confidence is boosted and they become more outgoing. To grow as a developer and stay relevant in the everchanging technological landscape, they must take the initiative to learn new development languages or explore emerging technologies. Only in doing so, can they truly make an impact in their field",1
"To gain further insight into the specifics of this career, I contacted people who were already working within the field in order to learn more about what was required of them and the skills they had developed in order to be successful. During my conversations, I discovered the courses I could take in order to gain the knowledge and skills needed to make me a top candidate for this field. 

After spending time researching various career options, I discovered a career that not only appealed to my skills and interests, but also fit my long-term goals. The combination of my skills and interests, along with the knowledge I had gained from speaking to people in this field, confirmed this. In my essay, I will explain why this career path is the right choice for me and how I can use the resources available to me to gain the necessary skills and experience to pursue it successfully.. 

Through all of my research, I determined that this career path was the perfect match for me",1
"On the one hand, there are potential advantages to lengthening the school day, such as additional classes and extracurriculars for students to participate in and increased teacher-student engagement. On the other hand, there are certainly some negative consequences if the school day is extended, such as more stress and burnout for both staff and students. Ultimately, the opinion of the students themselves should be taken into consideration when making this decision. After all, they are the ones who will be most impacted by this change.. 
The debate over whether or not the school board should extend the amount of time students are required to spend at school is a complex one that needs careful consideration of multiple perspectives",1
"For these reasons, the current school day should not be extended.. On the one hand, a longer school day could provide more time for learning, but on the other hand, it could lead to increased fatigue and cognitive impairment in students. 
Extending the school day by two hours could have both beneficial and detrimental effects on students. Furthermore, many students currently have after-school jobs, so two additional hours could limit their availability and slow their progress. Additionally, implementing a four-day week could reduce the availability of time to socialize and have free time. Ultimately, while it is intended to increase students’ educational success, the potential downsides might outweigh the benefits when considering the diverse needs of all students",1
"On the other hand, there may be some situations in which taking this path may not be the most suitable choice. When making the decision on whether or not to take this path, there are many factors to consider.

One of the clear benefits of graduating high school early is that it can provide additional job opportunities. 

Nowadays, students are increasingly looking for alternatives to the traditional high school experience. One of these alternatives is graduating in three years instead of the standard four. Therefore, each case must be assessed thoroughly before deciding whether or not this is the right move. Additionally, students may have to start paying bills and rent, which can be expensive.

In conclusion, it is important for school districts to carefully consider the pros and cons of allowing students to graduate early. There are numerous programs available that facilitate this, allowing students to complete their high school curriculums in a shorter amount of time. This could include having to independently pay for other living expenses, which may not be accessible to all students. Upon completion of a three-year program, students may have the opportunity to work, attend college, or volunteer.      . That being said, the decision to leave high school early could also have an impact on personal lives, such as having to move to a new area, leaving behind friends and family.

Besides the possible advantages, it is important to consider the financial implications of graduating in three years. Graduate students can also enter college at an earlier stage compared to others, possibly allowing them to enter graduate school faster than their peers and to start their career sooner. For many, the advantages can outweigh the potential drawbacks and provide a wide range of future possibilities",1
"She didn’t have to pay the costly fees associated with four years of high school. Additionally, he shared that it felt like a big transition from high school to college, having to jump right into rigorous college courses. On one hand, she was able to get a head start on her college education and saved a significant amount of money. She reported feeling organized and focused, but it was a lot of work to finish on time.

I also talked to another friend, Roger, who took the three-year high school program. 

It appears that the three-year high school program can be a successful option for some students, but it is not without drawbacks. It requires a great deal of planning, focus, and dedication to finish the program successfully.. He reported having to sacrifice his social life and extracurricular activities to keep up with his studies. On the other hand, she felt as though she was lacking preparation for some of her college classes because she had to cover a lot of material in a shorter period of time. 
My friend Amanda decided to take the challenge of completing her high school studies in three years",1
"By working with an older student, the younger student can benefit from a higher level of intelligence, better preparation for the future, and improved efficiency with their schoolwork.. The knowledge and experience the older student has to offer can help the younger one gain a better understanding of their subject material. Additionally, the older student can provide help with homework, allowing the younger student to get a better grasp of the material and develop stronger study skills over time. As an older student, the younger student can gain insight into what it will take to be successful in their studies as they prepare for life beyond school. 
Research has shown that having an older student assist in teaching a younger student provides numerous benefits",1
"Oprah Winfrey, another inspiring example, credits her abundant success to her decision to never doubt herself and to always think positively. For example, Apple co-founder, Steve Jobs, is known for his unwavering optimism, which helped him push through the difficult times during Apple’s early years and eventually led to great success. 
Having a positive attitude is essential to success in many aspects of life, including school, relationships, and dealing with difficult obstacles in life. In addition, when faced with difficult obstacles, those with a positive attitude can better recognize potential solutions and navigate their way to a better outcome. . 

Many successful people have achieved their success, in part, from having a positive attitude. Studies have shown that positivity not only helps boost morale and productivity, but can also affect outcomes in the situations mentioned above. In relationships, having a positive attitude encourages positive interactions between two people, resulting in better communication and a stronger bond. For instance, research has shown that students who have a more positive outlook on their academic performance tend to receive higher grades and do better on tests than those with a negative attitude. These stories exemplify how having a positive attitude can have a positive impact on one's life in a variety of ways",1
"In the past, the way to find out information about someone or something was to do research; however today, we can find out almost anything we want to know quickly and even communicate with people regardless of distance. From simple labor-reducing items such as washing machines and computers, to revolutionary communication tools like the Internet and smart phones, technology advances have altered the way we experience the world.

One of the most positive impacts of technology is the fact that it facilitates easier and faster communication between people. Also, spending too much time on digital devices can result in damage to relationships due to less face-to-face time with family and friends. For example, it can lead to an unhealthy sedentary lifestyle, as people often spend large amounts of time on the computer, instead of going outdoors and exercising. In addition, even mundane tasks such as online banking, grocery shopping, and paying bills can be done quickly and efficiently without ever having to leave the house.

Unfortunately, technology also has its downsides. Therefore, it is important to keep a balance between the two, in order to have a healthy and productive lifestyle.. 
Technology has changed the way we live our lives. It enables us to work more efficiently and communicate more easily; however, it can also lead to unhealthy habits and an overall decrease in motivation. In addition, technology is creating a world of instant gratification, which can lead to feelings of impatience with the non-digital world and can lead to a decrease in motivation and self-regulation.

Overall, technology has both positive and negative effects on our lives",1
"Exercising and participating in physical activities can place physical strain and stress on the body, which can lead to aches, pains, and injuries if one is not careful. 
Being active and having an active lifestyle can have many benefits and drawbacks. Staying active can also help one's mental health, as studies have shown that regular physical activity can help reduce levels of stress and depression. 

On the other hand, there are some drawbacks to living an active lifestyle. Additionally, not all forms of exercise are equal, and certain activities can involve more risk than others. One benefit of staying active is that it can help improve one's overall physical health, as it can aid in decreasing a variety of disease risks such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Furthermore, staying active requires motivation and dedication, which can be tough for some people to find.

In conclusion, while there are both benefits and drawbacks to living an active lifestyle, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. Engaging in regular physical activity and staying active can help one achieve overall physical and mental wellbeing, and can also help reduce the risks of many serious diseases.. Additionally, staying active can help maintain a healthy weight, and can even help one to look and feel better",1
"It is important to take the time to show understanding for the feelings and emotions of others, even if you don’t necessarily agree with them.

Demonstrating respect is important because it not only strengthens relationships but also makes a person more self-aware and helps build confidence. Treat everyone equally. 
Respect is a fundamental part of building strong relationships and something that should be demonstrated in our everyday interactions. This means having no double standards and treating people with the same level of politeness and courtesy regardless of their position or status.

3. In a work or school environment, respect can lead to a more positive and productive atmosphere and establishes trust amongst colleagues. Here are three ways to demonstrate respect: 

1. Show empathy. Respect for others leads to respect for ourselves, turning into a virtuous cycle.. Listening is a sign of respect because it shows you are interested in and value the other person’s opinion.

2. Listen actively and without judgment",1
"By doing so, we can ensure that our relationships with people, and our outlook on life, remain healthy and upbeat.. 

Additionally, our first impressions can determine how we look at the world. Whether we realize it or not, our initial impressions have a powerful impact on our relationships with other people. 
First impressions are incredibly important, and our initial encounters with people, ideas, and experiences will often set the tone for our future relationships. This can help to shape the way you feel about the world and can impact the way you interact with the people you meet from then on. When we realize that our instinctive knee-jerk reactions and gut feelings about people and situations should be taken seriously, we realize how much of an impact they can have on our lives. Our snap judgement of something or someone can impact us for the long haul, and this is especially true when it comes to forming lasting impressions of people. On the other hand, if the party is less than hospitable, that can lead you to believe in a more hostile view of the world. 

For instance, let’s suppose that you are starting at a new school and you have your first encounter with the principal. If that first meeting goes well, chances are you will have a good attitude about this person and feel respected and welcomed. To illustrate this point, let’s say that you walk into a party and you are immediately met with a feeling of warmth and acceptance. It is essential to pay close attention to these initial reactions and work to make sure that they are as positive as possible. However, if your first meeting with the principal is unpleasant, you are likely to treat them with distrust and antipathy, and it could color the way you view them for a long time. 

From these examples, it is clear that our first impressions can be incredibly powerful and can have a long lasting impact on our lives",1
"They may not have the educational background or internships necessary to enter professional fields. Elementary school students are typically unaware of the concept of a long-term job and tend to approach career choices from a more whimsical perspective. However, this belief fails to acknowledge the reality of the modern world in which teenagers can commit to long-term goals earlier on. 

Unfortunately, many adults may view teenagers as too inexperienced or immature to decide on a career. 
As students begin to develop a sense of individual identity, the career paths they pursue change drastically. Young people can demonstrate the breadth of their experience and knowledge which shows that not all adolescents are the same.

Even with the ambition and drive to pursue a career, teenagers still face unique challenges. Ultimately, committing to a career at a young age requires the willingness to learn and the patience to maneuver through an ever-changing landscape.. This age group may also begin to explore the creation of a resume and the development of professional skills. On the other hand, middle school students start to recognize the consequences of their decisions and may begin to commit to a career path. Moreover, due to their age, there are limits to the degree of responsibility they can take on",1

"I was enthralled by stories of brave princesses on long and treacherous journeys, always driven by a steadfast determination to achieve their goals. With every obstacle I faced, I held onto my determination like a comforting security blanket and it brought me to my ultimate goal.

It is through my own experiences that I have learned the importance of determination. At times, it can be the only thing that keeps me moving forward and allows me to accomplish goals no matter the roadblocks that lie in my path.. Little did I know that determination would become a quality I would need to lean on when dealing with the many obstacles life would throw my way. This quality has helped me in many facets of my life: from reaching personal goals, to overcoming adversity and even navigating interpersonal relationships. This was no small feat – but, with a newfound determination to create better opportunities for myself, I persevered. However, my determination to set and achieve my goals kept me motivated and, eventually, I was accepted into college. 

At the age of 15, my parents divorced and I was left feeling completely alone. I worked tirelessly to find after-school jobs that allowed me to save money for college.

It was difficult - I encountered numerous obstacles, including my own doubts and insecurities. I had to learn to manage my own finances while still focusing on my schoolwork. 
When I was a little girl, I loved to read about courageous adventurers",1
"On the other hand, if we take on a pessimistic attitude and focus on scenarios where we may fail, we become more apprehensive and inhibited about the whole process, killing our chances of success even before we’ve started. In essence, a positive attitude is a differentiator for success in life. It is, therefore, vital for us to maintain an optimistic and motivated outlook if we want to make the most out of our life endeavors.. Likewise, when studying for an exam, having a positive attitude enables us to stay focused on the task and to believe in our ability to remember the material.

The power of having a positive attitude goes beyond just making us feel better in the short-term. 
Having a positive attitude is essential for success in life. When we have a positive outlook, our brains become more oriented towards problem-solving, creative solutions, and success. We appear more professional and confident to the interviewer, thereby increasing our chances of success. When we have an optimistic attitude about the process, we feel more positive about the interview and our chances of landing the role. When we approach situations with a positive attitude, our minds become open and creative, allowing us to see all of the potential opportunities that await us. Not only does having a positive attitude enable us to see these opportunities, but it also gives us the motivation and confidence to take advantage of them.

To illustrate this, consider the example of applying for a job",1
"For students who would like to finish classes quickly, online classes or homeschooling can provide them with the flexibility to move at their own pace and speed up their education. For students who are considering dropping out, online classes or homeschooling can provide an alternate way to complete their course requirements and receive a diploma without having to face the traditional school setting. For students struggling in school, they can provide an alternate way to learn in a safe and comfortable environment with tailored, one-on-one instruction. 
Online classes and homeschooling offer several benefits to students struggling in school, those considering dropping out, and those eager to finish classes quickly. Through these methods of education, all sorts of students can find success and motivation in their studies.",1
"If we are static in our knowledge and in our experiences, we risk not developing our full potential. Taking on something that is beyond our current level of expertise stretches us and encourages us to develop better skills and learn more about the topic. 

For example, a professional tennis player might be considered to have already mastered the game of tennis. 
The old adage, ""If you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will grow,"" holds true in life. It is from these out-of-the-box pursuits that we have the capability to achieve greater levels of growth. We often become complacent when we feel we have mastered something, and this can halt our development. 

Growth comes from pushing ourselves to explore our capabilities beyond what we currently know. But if this player takes on a new development challenge by trying a different type of shot or by changing his or her grip in order to improve, the growth potential is immense. Similarly, a mathematician who has already earned a degree can grow further by taking on a more challenging problem or exploring a new area of mathematics. But when we push past our comfort zone and try something new, our ability to grow and expand our knowledge is limitless.",1
"Working with others forces us to think outside the box and break away from our limited perspectives.

More importantly, relying on others helps us to build meaningful relationships. We can learn from their experiences and share our own, creating an environment of trust, encouragement, and understanding. These are valuable traits, and often, they can carry a person through difficult times. This doesn’t mean that complete dependence on another person is ideal. Without these connections, individuals can be left feeling isolated and disempowered. Instead, we should strive for a balance of individual action and cooperation.

Individuals should strive for independence and self-sufficiency. It allows us to pool resources and ideas, expanding the range of possibilities. Relying on others is not about being weak or dependent; it is about seeing the strength in community and recognizing the importance of our shared resources. But relying on others gives us the support we need to tackle even greater challenges. With the help of others, there is no end to the heights that we can reach.. 
Relying on others is an essential part of life. 

In the end, knowing when to lean on others and when to be independent is the key to a fulfilling and successful life. We often don't realize the importance of relying on others until faced with a challenge that we cannot handle on our own",1
"

Having a positive attitude can give you the advantage that no one else has - the power of believing in yourself. It opens up a whole new world of possibilities to you, serving as a gateway to success. Developing a positive attitude helps you create a strong foundation of self-confidence and courage, allowing you to take risks, persevere through difficulties, and stay optimistic even when faced with difficulty. By embracing a positive outlook, you can unlock greater possibilities and opportunities to achieve success in life.. 

Having a positive attitude is also key to keeping your morale high. 

In conclusion, having a positive attitude and believing in yourself is of paramount importance if you want to succeed in life. Believing in yourself and being positive even when faced with difficulty, brings a sense of strength and resolution that helps you achieve your goals in life. If you stay positive and keep your chin up, you create an environment of self-confidence and courage. They thrive because they believe that no matter what happens, they're capable of handling it. 
Having a positive attitude is one of the most important factors in achieving success in life. It’s essential to believe in yourself and your abilities, even when everything seems to be against you. When you start believing in yourself, you are willing to take risks that others might be scared to take. Having faith in yourself, remaining positive, and keeping your head up high even in the face of failure can open doors to greater possibilities and opportunities in life. Successful people have this positive outlook on life, no matter what they do. Similarly, having a positive attitude fuels your inner perseverance and determination to keep going even when obstacles are thrown in your path",1
"All in all, having a positive attitude can have a tremendous impact on various aspects of life.. With a positive outlook, even the most daunting academic tasks can be conquered. Employers tend to be attracted to those who are enthusiastic and proactive, giving optimistic applicants a stronger advantage. When communicating with others, those with a positive attitude tend to come off as more approachable. Finally, a positive attitude helps in the educational arena by allowing individuals to stay focused and motivated through challenges. Furthermore, having a positive attitude can contribute to increased chances at finding employment. This can lead to better conversations and a deeper understanding of one another, which can lead to stronger relationships. 
Having a positive attitude can drastically impact many aspects of life, such as communication, job opportunities, and education",1
"Active lifestyles, in comparison to idle lifestyles, offer numerous advantages that encourage physical, mental, and emotional growth. These positive outcomes are often more tangible than those that come with idleness. Therefore, it is imperative for people to strive to stay engaged in activities that shape and inform their lives, allowing them to grow in a meaningful way.. If a person fails to stay motivated and productive, they risk remaining stagnant in their personal progress and achievements. In a workplace setting, those who demonstrate a willingness to contribute are seen as motivated and committed to their work, providing an example to colleagues and potentially resulting in rewards and recognition. 

There are a number of notable cases of individuals whose lives have been improved by actively engaging in activities. 
Staying actively engaged and participating in activities has been linked to many positive results, ranging from physical health benefits to improved mental wellbeing",1
"In a world that is constantly trying to define and make someone into something they are not, it is essential to stay true to oneself and develop self-acceptance, which can lead to a more rewarding and fulfilling life.. We may look to others for inspiration, and it can be tempting to emulate them in an effort to be accepted by others or have a false sense of accomplishment. 

When one is honest throughout their journey, relationships with others tend to thrive and love is shared in a meaningful way. Conversely, when one is dishonest or attempts to be someone else, those relationships suffer and trust is often lost. 
Sometimes in life it is easy to get carried away with the idea of being someone else. However, taking this approach can be detrimental in the long run and can lead to unsuccessful accomplishments. On the other hand, being true to one's self and staying in touch with one's own goals and values offers long term benefits, potentially even leading to true and authentic friendships",1
"His life story also illustrates the power of never being idle—by remaining consistent in his efforts, Jefferson was able to create extraordinary outcomes.

From studying law to becoming a prominent political leader, his achievements have served as an inspiration to generations of Americans. 
Thomas Jefferson was a quintessential example of a lifelong learner determined to never be idle. His legacy is a reminder of the importance of one's commitment to never be idle, and how even the smallest actions can add up to truly meaningful results.",1
"From advanced production processes to more efficient consumer interactions, businesses of all sizes and sectors have adopted modern technologies to streamline operations and maximize profits. 

At Ford, technology has given a distinct edge to the automotive manufacturing process. These changes have allowed restaurants to work more efficiently, while increasing customer satisfaction.

Finally, Walmart has taken advantage of technology to reduce costs and improve its customer experience. Ford, restaurants, and Walmart are no exception. In addition, Walmart has also implemented an automated checkout system, enabling customers to quickly and conveniently pay for their items with little effort.

Clearly, technology has had a major impact on the economy and human interactions. Automated production lines have replaced manual labor, and sophisticated tracking systems keep track of every aspect of the production process. It is clear that technology will continue to shape the economy and our everyday interactions for years to come.. Through the use of inventory and supply chain management solutions, Walmart can accurately track the availability of goods and dynamically adjust prices for consumers. By leveraging technology, businesses like Ford, restaurants, and Walmart have stayed ahead of the competition and provided better customer experiences. 
In just a few short decades, technology has revolutionized the economies of countries around the world. Technology has enabled Ford to build cars faster, while maintaining the highest level of quality and efficiency.

In the restaurant industry, mobile ordering, payment, and delivery systems have changed the way business is conducted. By implementing technologies like AI and machine learning, restaurants can easily accept orders online, pay without cash, and even deliver orders directly to customers' homes",1
"By being so focused on one task, we can sometimes lose sight of the bigger picture and miss out on how the task fits into a larger set of goals and objectives. By avoiding idling and staying focused on the task at hand, we are able to get more done in less time and achieve better results. 

Overall, while focusing on a single task can be extremely beneficial and help you achieve better results, it is important to remember that there are also some limitations to be aware of. Taking regular breaks and varying your tasks throughout the day can help ensure you stay focused and productive.. Additionally, if you are too focused on one task, you might become burnt out or lack enthusiasm for completing the same task on a regular basis. 
The importance of focusing on a single task and avoiding idling can not be overstated. It can also be hard to maintain focus on a single task for a long period of time without becoming easily distracted due to fatigue or boredom. With so many distractions in our daily lives, it’s easy to become overwhelmed and start putting off the task at hand. 

However, there are still some limitations to focusing on a single task. This focus on singular tasks allows us to dig deeper and explore the details of the task more thoroughly, making sure to not miss any important components",1

"A favorable first impression could be the difference between feeling accepted or rejected, and might even be a defining factor in maintaining meaningful connections. Unfortunately, the task of changing one’s first impression can be a difficult and arduous one, and requires persistence and effort. It is also important to recognize the effects the impression can have on relationships and future success. For all these reasons, first impressions can be incredibly important and should be observed carefully.. 
First impressions can have a lasting impact on one’s life. Furthermore, it can affect people's ability to find success in their future endeavors. It’s no wonder people are often concerned with the impression they make upon first meeting someone. Although a first impression can be challenging to change, it is possible to alter perspectives over time",1
"This can also have a significant impact on the environment and can help cut down on energy and resource consumption.

If applied to the education system, adopting a four-day school week model can likewise bring advantages to students, their families, and the environment. By closing the school for one day each week, energy costs go down, as well as the amount of paper, resources, and waste produced.

Families can also benefit from a four-day school week model, by having more days of freedom to get out and explore. Furthermore, the four-day school week model helps reduce energy and resource consumption. They can also use their three-day weekend to rest and recharge for the next week, reducing their stress levels and anxiety about homework and tests. It will help create a healthier, more successful environment for those involved while helping reduce stress, energy consumption, and resource waste.. For example, students can have more flexibility in their schedules, allowing them to spend additional time on outside activities, such as music lessons, sports, hobby clubs, and community work. They can save money on transportation to and from school and on extracurricular activities, as well as less food waste produced from lunches. Additionally, they will have more time to connect more often as a family.

By adopting a four-day school week model, students, their families, and the environment can yield benefits. By reducing the number of days worked each week to four, employees have more days off, leading to lower stress levels, increased motivation and fresh energy for the days worked. 
    More and more businesses are beginning to embrace the idea of a four-day workweek",1
"A positive attitude allows you to stay optimistic and focus on the positives in life. It gives you the motivation to keep going, even when things seem difficult. Finally, when I was helping my mother out of a difficult situation, a positive attitude allowed me to be there for her without getting bogged down with any negativity.

My experiences have shown me that a positive attitude is a key to success. I was able to stay focused and stay on track instead of getting overwhelmed and giving up. A positive attitude also helped me set and achieve my goals. 
Having a positive attitude has made a huge impact on my life experiences. For instance, when I moved to a new country, I had to learn a new language. Having a positive attitude helped me stay motivated and pushed me to reach my goal of becoming fluent. With this mindset, I believe that I can go far and reach any goal I set for myself.",1
"

First and foremost, most students would likely oppose this idea due to the extended time spent in school each day, along with the weekends no longer being a block of days to catch up on assignments and prepare for tests. 

Overall, extending the school day to two more hours and having a four day school week could have significant consequences for students, teachers, and schools. Although there could be some advantages to this type of scheduling change, school administrators need to carefully consider all of the potential issues before moving forward.. Furthermore, the additional time for instruction might lead to more frequent lesson plans and the need for additional grading and feedback from the teachers. 
School administrators have proposed extending the school day by two hours and having a four day school week. In addition, this might lead to more absences from school due to fatigue and poorer academic performance as a result of the extended day. 

In terms of schools, implementing a four-day week and extended day schedule could have some potential logistical issues. If implemented, this change could have several potential consequences for students, teachers, and schools. 

For teachers, this type of schedule could mean that more planning and preparation for classes would need to be done to make the two extra hours meaningful and worthwhile. This additional planning might pose a challenge for some teachers and could lead to burnout. The extra time might place more stress on students, negatively affecting their mental health. Schools would need to ensure that enough buses are available for the extended route times, along with the management of cafeteria routines, student drop-off and pick-up times, and the coordination of sports and extracurricular activities",1
"This change could improve the health of students and contribute to overall well-being. Ultimately, this change could ensure that students get the sustenance they need to thrive.. It could also provide students who are unwell with healthier and nutritious meals, give students participating in school sports the nutritional requirements for their sport, and provide those who may be going hungry with a balanced and nutritious diet. Finally, students who may not be receiving enough nutrients or variety at home could receive the necessary vitamins and minerals that their bodies need for growth.

The advantages of changing the school lunch menu are extensive. For one, students who are typically unwell or have physical illnesses could greatly benefit from a menu that provides healthier and more nutritious meals. Additionally, those who participate in school sports could benefit from a menu that is specifically tailored to ensure they are receiving the necessary vitamins and minerals that will help with hydration, energy, and muscle repair. 
The topic of changing the school lunch menu is highly important, and carries with it a variety of advantages for students",1
"However, some school districts have begun allowing students to graduate a year early. 
High school graduation is often looked upon as a milestone for students to celebrate as the end of a long educational journey. The benefits may be enticing, but there are many potential downsides to consider.. 

Most importantly, graduates who jump the gun and finish high school early could be missing out on valuable learning experiences. 

For these reasons, schools districts should not make it possible for all high school students to graduate a year early. Not having the same college exposure as other peers or lacking the maturity that comes with an extra year of school can hold graduates back from success in the long-run. Though this can be beneficial in certain cases, there are several compelling reasons why this practice should not be made universally available to all high school students. 

In addition, early graduation can leave students feeling unprepared for the world outside of high school. High school is a formative period and the curriculum is designed to prepare young adults for college or the workforce. Graduating a year earlier than expected does not always mean students will attend college earlier; in fact, it could mean starting a career ill-equipped to handle all the responsibilities that come with being a full-time working adult. Skipping ahead by a year could lead to students not having enough guidance or mentorship available while learning vital skills and life lessons",1
"In addition, this individual can learn how to analyze a situation from multiple points of view, allowing this person to make more informed choices beyond the dilemma in question.  

This method can also provide an individual with a more in-depth understanding of the situation, as each party usually provides their personal perspective that can contextually provide more information. Furthermore, by listening to a variety of counsel, one may be exposed to new ideas and solutions to a problem, reaffirming convictions or allowing for a more personalized solution. By doing this, one can gain perspectives from a more diverse range of sources, allowing for a more balanced and informed decision. 
       
Overall, seeking advice from different people can be an invaluable asset that can help someone greatly in life, both in the short-term and long-term. With a broad range of experiences and perspectives, gathering advice from multiple people is a tool with great potential to help someone make more thoughtful and sound decisions that can have a lasting and positive impact.. 
Asking multiple people for advice can be a beneficial decision-making strategy. This could lead to a better choice than what might be derived from a single opinion",1
"It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well.” 

For example, taking the time to help an elderly neighbor by running errands for them or volunteering at a local food pantry are two ways we can demonstrate empathy and kindness to those around us. Doing new activities can keep our minds sharp and help us be more open to new experiences. In addition, taking the time to help others in our lives can bring much needed joy and satisfaction. 
Learning something new each day is important for personal growth and development. Likewise, learning something new such as a language, cooking a new recipe, or learning how to play an instrument can help us find more joy in everyday life and develop our life skills. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, “The purpose of life is not to be happy. By taking time to learn and help, we can bring purpose to our own lives and make a difference in the lives of others.",1
"In order to meet this goal, I had to commit to regular running and to gradually increase the duration and intensity of my runs. Although growing requires a degree of risk and vulnerability, it is those who take such risks and step outside of their comfort zones who find the greatest rewards.. 

Alternatively, I witnessed the opposite situation when someone I knew set a goal that they were unable to reach. 
I have personally experienced the empowerment that comes from rising to the challenge of something I have never done before. They felt a sense of failure and disappointment quite keenly and I could see how this had the potential to discourage them from doing things that were outside of their comfort zone. I once set a goal of running a half marathon, a goal that seemed lofty and daunting given that I was a beginner runner. Despite their initial enthusiasm for their goal, they eventually lacked the confidence and perseverance to stay committed to the goal. 

Ralph Waldo Emerson's quote ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" is highly applicable here. I discovered a huge sense of satisfaction and accomplishment from pushing myself beyond my physical and mental limitations. With persistence, I was able to achieve my goal and even surpass it",1
"However, they do agree that the school should provide more resources and support for students, as well as prioritize mental health. Some suggested alternatives that I gathered from my peers include increasing the number of classes with fewer students, implementing more activities that promote equal access for all students, and providing more student-teacher mentoring opportunities. I have presented my findings to the school's administration and look forward to seeing how they respond.. These alternative solutions could be beneficial to the student body and could benefit the school in the long run. 
After surveying the opinions of my peers, I have found that the majority do not support the idea of adding 1.5 hours to the school day",1
"

In conclusion, while extending the school day four days a week could potentially bring many benefits, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks and implications for students' mental and physical health. Careful assessment should be taken to ensure that any decisions made are beneficial to the students and school in the long-term.. Additionally, it could potentially provide additional time for students to explore and get involved in extracurricular activities, giving them extra opportunities to engage and learn outside of the classroom. Furthermore, the additional hours spent in school could significantly reduce students' free time and availability for social activities, which can be detrimental to adolescents' developmental needs. From a resource conservation standpoint, extending the school day could help to reduce the gaps between classes, conserve energy, and lessen the need for additional buses and vehicles for transport. 
Extending the school day two hours and four days a week has potential benefits as well as potential drawbacks. Longer school days could lead to higher levels of stress and exhaustion, as well as more difficulty managing workloads. 

On the other hand, increasing the length of the school day could have a negative effect on students' mental and physical health",1
"
When it comes to personal development and success, there is often a need to make a choice between being productive and being idle. By working hard and pushing yourself to go above and beyond, you can develop the skills and knowledge needed to be successful. Being productive is linked to developing new strengths, talents, and abilities that can lead to greater success in life. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide which approach is best suited to their current situation, but both being productive and being idle can lead to personal growth and success.. On the other hand, sometimes being idle and taking a break from work can be just as beneficial. Taking a step back provides an opportunity for self-reflection and rejuvenation, enabling you to find clarity, focus, and inner peace",1
"In one camp, it is argued that requiring students to maintain a certain academic standard helps to reward hard work in the classroom and also encourages them to take their studies seriously as opposed to being a distraction from their academic pursuits. Rather, it is important to provide support and mentorship for struggling students to ensure they receive the education and resources they need to succeed.. A policy such as this can ultimately have the opposite intended effect, as it may serve to discourage low-income students and other minorities from participating in activities due to the additional difficulty in meeting the required average. 
The subject of requiring students to maintain a B average in order to participate in sports or other activities has caused significant debate among educators, students, and other stakeholders. 

My position is that requiring a B average to participate in school activities is an unfair policy that can heavily impact students who are struggling with their school work and put a financial burden on families who already struggle to afford extracurricular activities. On the other side, however, some have raised the point that this policy could unfairly limit the opportunities of some students who may excel in activities such as sports or the arts but lack the academic skills needed to maintain a B average. Furthermore, it could potentially lead to alienation among students who are unable to meet the academic requirements, which would further impact their engagement in school activities. 

While the intention of requiring a B average is to ensure students have a strong academic foundation, the potential consequences and disadvantages of such a policy suggest that it is not an effective solution for achieving this goal",1
"While this policy is intended to ensure teachers and students can focus on their learning, it has proven to be somewhat ineffective. If students are seen using cell phones for any other activity, they should be subject to disciplinary action. Lastly, the school should provide information to both teachers and students regarding the revised policy, so everyone is aware of what is expected of them

By introducing these changes, the current policy on cell phone use in the school can be revised to make it fair and effective for both teachers and students.. 
Currently, there is a policy in place to restrict the use of cell phones during school hours. For instance, teachers should check for phones during examinations and, if applicable, confiscate them from students who use them inappropriately. First, teachers should be allowed to carry their cell phones on-campus during school hours. 

Second, students should be allowed to use their phones for educational purposes only, such as using online dictionaries and conducting research. 

Finally, stricter enforcement of the policy should be in place. This will allow them to stay connected to the outside world and provide an easy means of communication if necessary. 

To achieve this, a few changes should be implemented. As a result, it is proposed that the current policy on cell phone use in the school be revised to provide a more balanced approach for both teachers and students",1
"There are many reasons why it can be beneficial to talk to more than one person when asking for advice. Lastly, talking to more than one person can help to provide comfort and reassurance in taking on difficult decisions. If multiple people independently give the same advice when asked, it can help to verify its credibility. Additionally, it can help to confirm or dispute advice given. Talking to multiple people can help to provide an array of different ideas and solutions that one person may have overlooked. When multiple sources are in agreement, it can provide more assurance that the advice given is sound.

In conclusion, it can be beneficial to talk to more than one person when asking for advice in order to gain more perspectives, verify advice, and provide reassurance in decision making.. First, seeking out multiple perspectives allows for a more diverse range of advice. 
Getting advice is an important part of navigating life's decisions, but sometimes getting the best advice requires talking to more than one person",1
"Having different ideas from other members of the group provides an opportunity to explore and to create a well-rounded outcome. Firstly, collaboration is key when completing a task. Furthermore, working in a group allows multiple perspectives and approaches to be discussed and weighed up. 
Working in a group has many benefits that can outweigh working alone. Open dialogue and discussion can ensure that everyone is kept informed, and that any misunderstandings are quickly identified. Working together can also create a sense of unity and solidarity that would not be possible in an individual setting.

In conclusion, working in a group can be hugely beneficial for many reasons, including collaboration, communication, faster work and improved understanding.. Working in a group also allows tasks to be completed at a faster pace, with people able to specialise in certain areas or to take on specific roles.

Finally, working in a group facilitates understanding in ways that working alone does not. Members of the group can provide support and guidance, and help each other to grow in knowledge and skills. The range of knowledge and expertise found in a group can lead to better decision making and a higher quality of work.

Communication is also improved when working as a team",1
"Listen actively and without judgment. It is important to take the time to show understanding for the feelings and emotions of others, even if you don’t necessarily agree with them.

Demonstrating respect is important because it not only strengthens relationships but also makes a person more self-aware and helps build confidence. Listening is a sign of respect because it shows you are interested in and value the other person’s opinion.

2. Treat everyone equally. Respect for others leads to respect for ourselves, turning into a virtuous cycle.. Show empathy. This means having no double standards and treating people with the same level of politeness and courtesy regardless of their position or status.

3. 
Respect is a fundamental part of building strong relationships and something that should be demonstrated in our everyday interactions. Here are three ways to demonstrate respect: 

1. In a work or school environment, respect can lead to a more positive and productive atmosphere and establishes trust amongst colleagues",1

    After researching the opinions of family and friends when buying new shoes, it is clear that gathering knowledge from multiple sources can be hugely beneficial. This can help make an informed decision and potentially save both time and money. It is essential to ask people who are more experienced in the particular topic in order to get a better understanding of the specific situation. Doing research and consulting multiple people can help make informed decisions and save time and money.. Depending on the type of shoe, it is important to ask people for their ideas on which style is best, as well as tips on size and fit. In conclusion, asking family and friends for their advice and opinion when buying new shoes is invaluable",1
"For one, it provides an opportunity for students to learn to appreciate the diverse perspectives and expertise of their peers, which can be an invaluable asset in the process of brainstorming and problem solving strategies. Additionally, group work can be an effective way to divide up work, maximize efficiency, and help students gain a better understanding of topics through the process of peer teaching. Group work also provides a heightened level of accountability since students are more likely to take ownership of their contributions when working with others. Furthermore, the emphasis on respect and teamwork encourages students to develop interpersonal skills and learn to collaborate effectively in order to foster successful outcomes. 
Group work offers several key advantages over working on an individual level. While group work is not without its drawbacks, when facilitated properly, it can be a powerful tool to help students achieve academic success.",1
"are typically in session for around seven to seven and a half hours each day. 
    
According to the National Center for Education Statistics, most schools in the U.S. Likewise, students may feel the pressure of being expected to perform better due to the extended hours. With extended school hours, the potential for these activities to be cut out increases, leading to a significant disruption to students' leisure activities. With the possibility of extending school hours in the U.S., it is important to consider how this may impact students beyond the classroom.

In the United States, students often engage in a variety of activities after school, such as soccer practice, guitar lessons, or volunteering. Parents may need to adjust their work schedules in order to accommodate the additional hours while also finding ways to supervise children after school. Given the potential consequences of extended school hours, it is necessary to properly weigh the pros and cons before making any decisions.. Can students, who are expected to take part in a variety of after-school activities, balance the increased workload? Will it be to the detriment of their physical and mental health? 

Extended school hours could also increase stress for both students and their families. This number, however, pales in comparison to the many countries around the world where students attend school for over eight hours each day. It is also important to consider the physical and emotional impacts that extended school hours will have on students",1
"She was suddenly filled with newfound confidence and self-belief, and was able to make astounding progress in her life. 
Alice had been feeling stuck in her life for years, unable to find the motivation to make a meaningful change. Hearing their story inspired Alice to go out and make the changes she wanted, and the results were astonishing.

"I now strive for success in everything I do, but only after having embraced failure and its importance in helping me become the person I am today.. I know this from personal experience. It wasn't until I began to believe in my own strengths and refused to let failure define me that I felt empowered to continue on. 
Excerpt:
Failure can be a formidable opponent, but it is also an opportunity to reset and begin anew. Growing up, I was filled with doubt and mistrust of my abilities. After a few failed attempts at pursuing a passion, I felt disconnected and unsure of my place in the world. Through the lens of self-motivation, there is no greater tool to learn from failure and turn it into a catalyst for success",1
"A longer summer break, however, would give students more time to relax and relieve any stress from the year. 

Weighing both sides of the debate, there is a strong argument to be made for changing the length of summer vacation for high school students. On the other hand, proponents of a shorter summer break argue that students need more time in the classroom to keep up their educational progress. With a shorter summer break, students could build on their academic knowledge and fill in any potential gaps they might have. On the other hand, with a longer summer break students could relax and take the time to explore their interests with the added benefit of refreshing their minds and bodies for the upcoming school year.. Additionally, longer summer holidays could also give students the opportunity to do more exploring, such as taking abroad trips to enrich their knowledge and learn more about the world.

Ultimately, it is important to consider how changing the length of summer vacation for high school students could benefit them and their educational progress. The length of summer vacation for high school students has been debated for some time. A shorter summer break would give students the opportunity to learn more in the classroom and avoid the learning gap that often takes place over long school holidays. Proponents of a longer summer break argue that students need the additional time to rest and recuperate from the demands of the academic year. 
High school students often look forward to summer vacation as a time to take a break from their heavy workloads and enjoy some well-deserved rest and relaxation",1
"Furthermore, Supreme stores have risen in value and resell potential in recent years, fostering a sense of social inclusion and exclusivity. Some of the prospective benefits one can expect from working in a Supreme store include on-the-job learning experiences, ample job flexibility, and cutting-edge knowledge about Supreme’s products and collaborations.. 

To the potential employee, working at Supreme provides a sense of creativity, accomplishment, and collaboration that can extend beyond the conventional retail job. A day at Supreme is typically marked by friendly service, engaging conversations with customers, and productivity-driven tasks.

"On the other hand, it has created an over reliance on technology in many aspects of our lives and caused many of us to become more isolated from each other and more disconnected from meaningful activities outside of our screens. The ubiquity of the online world has also opened the door for greater cyber security risks and threats to our data privacy. Ultimately, technology can be a double-edged sword, and its effects on our lives will depend largely on how we use it.. On one hand, it has brought unimaginable convenience and comfort, allowing us to stay connected with one another more quickly and easily than ever before. It has also made discovering new information and sources of entertainment easier and more accessible than ever before. 
Technology has revolutionized the lives of people all around the world",1
"Furthermore, the extended weekend could allow for good recreational activities and potentially more time spent with family.

On the flipside, the downside to a four-day, ten-hour school week may be that students will be required to attend school for a much longer period of time each day than usual. 
The debate over the potential pros and cons of switching to a four-day, ten-hour school week has been raging for some time. This could encourage them to better manage their time, become more organized, and complete tasks more efficiently. Additionally, it could cause them to lose valuable time with friends and affect their social development.

Ultimately, the decision to adopt or reject a four-day, ten-hour school schedule should only be made after careful consideration of both its potential benefits and drawbacks. It is important for administrators to keep in mind that an effective school day should provide students with a balance of academic and extracurricular activities, and should ensure that their physical and mental health are both taken into account.. On the other hand, opponents of this concept worry that it could cause kids to experience fatigue and lack of focus due to the length of each day.

In terms of advantages, there is the potential for improved student productivity due to the shorter but longer school days. Proponents of this idea argue that it could provide students with more breaks and lighter homework loads, as well as giving them more time to explore and pursue activities beyond the classroom. This could lead to feelings of exhaustion and could be particularly difficult for younger students who are already more susceptible to tiredness",1
"Overall, technology has made remarkable improvements to the lives of people in the areas of emergency, transport, education, and security..

While there have been more traditional ways of taking classes throughout educational history, the emergence of online courses and virtual video conferencing have made it possible for busy students and those living far away from their desired schools to benefit from quality education. These classes present more convenience to those who have a baby or who need to go to work, allowing them to complete their coursework at their own pace and in the comfort of their own homes. With no physical boundaries, educational opportunities are enabled for those who may not otherwise have access to them. This can be highly beneficial for those with commitments that may prevent them from taking classes in a traditional setting, and can open up many learning opportunities for students.. 

In an online setting, students have the advantage of greater flexibility and being able to work around other commitments. Virtual meetings with professors can ensure that the student remains engaged and is able to interact with their professor much in the same way as if they were in a physical classroom. Additionally, online coursework provides the ability to access material from multiple resources, giving students a more in-depth understanding of the course. While there may be specific deadlines for assignments, students can utilize the convenience of online to their advantage and submit work when it's most convenient for them. This can also be beneficial for those who may not be able to attend traditional classes, such as those with physical disabilities. 

Overall, taking classes online or through video conferencing can provide busy students and those interested in classes with more convenience. 

For students living far away from their school, taking classes through video conferencing can provide many of the same advantages",1
"For example, praise them for their hard work and determination to practice and master a skill. Praising effort rather than results can make children feel confident in trying out new tasks without worrying about the outcome.

Another important thing to remember when praising students is to be genuine. Genuine praise will create more positive reactions in children and will motivate them to keep trying and doing their best.

Overall, praising students is an essential tool for helping to build self-esteem. Praise can create a positive environment and teach children that it is alright to take risks and challenge themselves, even if there may be some failures along the way.

When praising students, it is important to be specific. Children can detect when someone is insincere, and when they do it can have the opposite effect on their self-esteem. 
Praising students is an important part of building self-esteem. Self-esteem is a child's belief in their ability to succeed and meet goals. Rather than general statements like ‘good job’, focus on the process a child utilized to get good results. It helps to ensure that they face challenges with a positive attitude. It helps children to understand that trying and failing is a part of life, and that success may not come immediately but with effort and determination it can be achieved.",1

Advancements in technology have revolutionized the way that societies interact and can be considered a double-edged sword. On one hand, technology has done wonders to bridge the gap between different cultures and facilitate cross-border economic transactions, yet technology can also create limitations in human contact. 

When it comes to mental health, technology limits on human contact can have both a negative and positive influence. On one hand, too much reliance on technology can result in feelings of isolation and loneliness, yet virtual conversations may also provide an emotional outlet and promote engagement with others. 

Lastly, social relationships are affected in both positive and negative ways by technological restrictions on human contact. 

In conclusion, technological limitations on human contact may have both positive and negative effects on physical and mental health, social relationships, and economic effects. Alongside this, technological advancements are also altering economic transactions, as an increasing number of businesses are turning to online platforms to better communicate with their customers. Consequently, careful consideration and evaluation must be taken in order to maximize the benefits of technology while curtailing any potential detrimental effects.. For instance, virtual communication can facilitate social support, yet can also replace many meaningful interactions that would typically occur in-person, thereby diminishing human connection. Conversely, virtual connections may promote healthier relationships since users can virtually communicate with peers, thus reducing physical danger associated with face-to-face interactions. 

In terms of physical health, technology-induced limits to human contact may lead to a decrease in physical exercise and, consequently, in overall fitness. Consequently, it is necessary to evaluate the positive and negative effects of such restrictions on physical and mental health, social relationships, and economics",1
"On the other hand, having phones can also give rise to cyberbullying and cheating, which can be harmful to students and make for a worse learning environment. 

Although phones can be useful in a classroom setting for certain activities, such as searching for information or taking notes, the potential distraction that can come from phones should not be allowed to disrupt a class. They can cause noise, distraction, cyberbullying, and cheating. During school hours, cell phones bring potential distractions from the lesson and can create a lot of noise in the classroom. Having phones in the classroom also disrupts the learning process as it encourages students to fall into a multitasking mindset—responding to messages or notifications when they should instead be concentrating on the lecture. 

With students texting friends, playing games, and checking social media, it can be difficult for both students and teachers to focus on the class syllabus and stay on task. Allowing students to bring their phones into the classroom can be more of a hindrance than a help. 
Cell phones are a great way to keep in touch with the outside world, but they have no place inside a school building during class hours. 

Ultimately, having cell phones in the classroom during school hours is more of a hindrance than a help. For these reasons, student should not be allowed to bring their phones into the classroom.",1
"Whether in school, at work, or even in sports, we can identify times when we moved closer to success because of action.

In conclusion, the idea of taking action in order to reach success is valid, and it is proved time and time again by history and our personal experiences. Not only did she become the first African-American billionaire, she also created many platforms to help empower women around the world. Examining successful individuals is a great way to illustrate this point. If we look back at examples in history, there is a clear correlation between taking action and reaching success. 
The idea of always striving to do something in order to improve one's life is a widely accepted view that is here to stay. Furthermore, if we look at our own lives, any time we took action we moved closer towards our goals. Those who do not take action at some point in their lives and instead choose to sit and wait for something to happen are much less likely to reach success. For example, Oprah Winfrey grew up with little opportunity and faced immense poverty growing up; however, she pursued every opportunity she had, and became one of the most successful individuals in the world. 

Opposing this view, some may argue that taking action is not the sure-fire way to reach success. This is, however, an incorrect view to take. Sitting and waiting for something to happen will almost never lead to success; rather, taking action as consistently as possible is much more likely to bring us closer to reaching our goals.",1

In conclusion, first impressions can be impacted by a person's past or environment. 
First impressions can be formed many ways; whether through physical and emotional events, such as the way a person looks and acts, or through various environmental factors, such as the people, places, monuments, and conversations a person is exposed to. Agreement plays a significant role here, as people who are able to empathize and understand one another's point of view tend to form more positive impressions. The way two people communicate to one another, as well as the places and people a person comes in contact with, can affect initial impressions. Specific examples of how this can be achieved include gaining new experiences, being more open-minded and tolerant to new ideas, and forming positive relationships. For example, if someone has experienced a series of negative events, they may be more likely to have a negative outlook on life and be less likely to have a positive initial impression. Conversely, communication that lacks agreement can lead to negative impressions. 

Although the past and environment can impact first impressions, it is possible to change them. 

The conversation between two people is a big factor in the formation of first impressions. It is possible for the past experiences or environment to affect first impressions. It is worth noting, however, that first impressions are not always accurate, and getting to know a person better can often lead to more positive and lasting impressions. However, one is never truly stuck with their first impression, as it is possible to change them by having new experiences, being open-minded, and forming positive relationships.",1

The power of imagination has been described as an invaluable tool for navigating the world. Knowledge is important and necessary; it is a form of understanding and can be critical for learning. Imagination can be the foundation for creativity and inspiration to solve problems, unleash progress, and fuel progress for generations to come.. This freedom shapes the world we live in, as well as the future generations. It provides an expansive view of reality that can lead us to achieving greatness. It gives us the power to explore the seemingly impossible, producing radical ideas and stimulating creative problem-solving.

It can be argued that imagination is essential for progress. It has the potential to expose us to revolutionary ideas that can lead to groundbreaking discoveries. Imagination is fluid, without bounds or rules. Imagination allows us to think beyond the limits of our own knowledge, challenging us to explore unknown territories. But knowledge can often be rigid and restrictive, adhering to traditional ideas with limited potential for growth or innovation. It can create and shape one's perception of reality, while producing seemingly limitless possibilities for the future. 

When comparing imagination to knowledge, imagination takes the lead. Creativity and innovation are paramount for collective growth, and these qualities could not be achieved without the freedom of imagination. 

In conclusion, imagination is more important than knowledge for many reasons",1

Ralph Waldo Emerson, an influential philosopher and poet, believed that knowledge and understanding come through living boldly and fearlessly. He encouraged his readers to venture outside of their comfort zone and take risks, emphasizing that growth comes from doing things we are terrified of.

Furthermore, this requirement allows the school to ensure that students can handle the extra workload associated with extracurricular activities, while still balancing their academic responsibilities. This gracefully encourages students to strive to do their best in school, and understand the importance of working hard to achieve their goals. 
As a student, I believe that requiring students to maintain a grade C average to participate in extracurricular activities is a wise decision. In my opinion, students should understand that there is a direct correlation between their academic performance and their ability to participate in activities outside of the classroom. 

Overall, I believe this policy to require a grade C average is a beneficial change for the school activities. Ensuring this balance will lead to increased student success, as well as fewer overwhelmed and stressed students. It is crucial that students take the time to invest in their education and understand the importance of good grades, and this policy encourages them to make the effort.

"By taking into account the diverse needs of students, educators can take advantage of online education to make up for missed school days due to personal, health, or sports considerations. 

In-person and online classrooms offer their own unique advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, remote learning can ensure that students are not disadvantaged by weather-related cancellations, minimizing disruptions to schooling. With careful consideration of time management, distractions, and potential isolation, remote learning can be advantageous for students with missed school days or weather-related interruptions.. As such, it is important to weigh all potential factors before deciding between an online or in-person learning environment.

All in all, online education can meet a variety of needs, often allowing students to learn in a more flexible manner that suits their individual needs. That said, online education can be lonely and isolating, as students miss out on conversations and collaborations with their peers. 
Online education has grown rapidly over the past decade, providing convenient and flexible opportunities for students to learn. Time management is an important factor to consider; in online classrooms, students are often responsible for establishing their own study time, whereas an instructor can structure a traditional classroom to ensure that learning time is used efficiently. Furthermore, online learning can be less distracting, as students have more control over their environment",1
"It can often be too costly for schools with already strained budgets. 
Schools should not be year-round for many reasons, the foremost of which has to do with the importance of summertime for students. By taking regular summer breaks, students are able to come into the new school year fresher and more motivated. In contrast, summertime can be a much-needed break for the school system and for administrators. Summer offers students a chance to rest and explore, the quality of their learning is improved, and it can be more cost-effective for school systems.. Summer breaks also allow students to spend more time with their family and friends, which can be especially beneficial for teenage development.

Finally, longer school years are expensive and can put incredible strain on school systems. 

Moreover, research shows that longer hours of schooling actually decrease education quality. 

In summary, summertime is a vital part of the school year for students, and schools should not be year-round. When students are in school for too long, the quality and quantity of learning decreases. It gives them the opportunity to learn and explore outside of the classroom in ways traditional schooling cannot. Summertime is a time for students to de-stress and take a break from the rigor of regular school life. Year-round schools require additional funds for staffing, utilities, and resources",1

Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ""That which we persist in doing becomes easier, not that the nature of the task has changed, but our ability to do has increased."" His statement rings true in my own experience of learning to play a musical instrument and a sport. Setting goals and challenging myself to reach them meant spending more and more time practicing, pushing myself beyond the limits I knew I was capable of. 

But growth can be difficult. It's not easy to keep up motivation and enthusiasm for something that can seem insurmountable. I experienced the joy of growth, because I could feel my abilities increasing as I continued to work hard. But the payoff of success feels all the greater when, with the help of dedication and perseverance, I am able to push myself and find new heights of excellence.. It often required patience, dedication, and perseverance in the face of frustration when I did not achieve my goals or faced setbacks",1
"The process of learning from failure can be a long and difficult one, but the fact that the individual is pushing past rejection and disappointment to continue to work towards success should be recognized. Ultimately, these personal successes can lead to even higher achievements, and a greater chance of the individual reaching their goals. It is through failure that an individual can discover what works and matters, and have the determination to move forward despite not having the outcome they had initially planned for. With trials and tribulations, and a belief in oneself, success can be achieved.. 

The truth of Churchill’s quote is that success is not always guaranteed, and failure is a natural part of the process. Winston Churchill’s quote, “Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,” conveys the idea that an individual’s enthusiasm and perseverance will be what helps them learn from failure and succeed.

The idea that failure can be an aid in the pursuit of success is one based on the notion of an individual using their failures to fuel further growth and success. No one starts out knowing how to achieve success; instead, they learn from their mistakes and use them to drive future decisions. 
When it comes to seeking success, it is often assumed that the journey itself is what will ultimately determine if an individual is successful or not. Rather than giving up when faced with rejections and defeats, an individual should focus on trusting the process and using every obstacle as an opportunity to learn and grow. 

The success of an individual is not only determined by the number of successes they accumulate, but also by their willingness to try new opportunities even after failure",1
"In video conferencing, the instructor might not be able to physically demonstrate something, which can make it harder to understand the topic.

In conclusion, online and video conferencing classes offer a unique set of benefits and drawbacks. Additionally, with video conferencing, students can better understand facial expressions and body language that they might miss in an online course.

A potential downside to both online and video conferencing classes is the lack of student engagement. 
Taking online or watching video conferencing classes has a number of pros and cons that must be considered. One of the greatest advantages of online and video conferencing classes is convenience; students can access and participate from anywhere, anytime on their own schedule. It can be harder to stay focused and engaged in an online or video conferencing environment due to a lack of physical presence and interaction with peers and instructors. Ultimately, the advantages and disadvantages should be weighed carefully in order to choose the best learning method for an individual student..

"In a study conducted in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, it was found that one’s perception of another person can be modified with knowledge. Despite popular belief, these first impressions can be changed over time. This knowledge often comes in the form of connecting with shared interests or gaining a true understanding of the other person’s true character. 

In conclusion, first impressions are not always accurate and can be changed. Fast forward to college, and we’re now more like siblings than friends. 

One example of this comes from my own personal experience. This is evident in my own personal experience, as well as in various scientific studies that have been conducted. This in turn allows for the development of a meaningful relationship that alters the initial perception of the other persons traits. My best friend in high school was someone I initially thought I had nothing in common with. Understanding the true character of a person or gaining an understanding of shared interests has the potential to change the perception of a first impression, allowing for a strong connection.. Despite our different backgrounds – she was a first-generation immigrant from East Asia and I’m from a rural background halfway across the world – we’ve grown to understand each other and found areas of shared interest that have helped bond us closer than ever.

This is further supplemented by scientific evidence that supports the idea that first impressions can be changed. 
First impressions can be deceiving, and sometimes it’s not until we know someone better that we realize their true character. We had completely different personalities and interests, so much so that we rarely shared a conversation, let alone became friends",1
"

When students work in a school setting, they benefit from frequent social interactions and the varied perspectives of their classmates. At the same time, students can maintain contact with their peers and teachers online through video conferencing to ensure they do not miss out on the social connections while also avoiding potential problems of in-person interaction. 

However, working from home has its own set of benefits. Both options offer advantages, and it is important to assess a student's particular needs and their preferences before making a decision.. Social interactions, academic improvement, and peer support are the main choices that need to be weighed in this decision. This can be particularly beneficial for students who are more independent and self-motivated and need less guidance. They can utilize their differences to collaborate closely on projects, which can in turn lead to better academic performance. Students are able to work in a comfortable and distraction-free environment. 

Ultimately, the decision as to whether students should work in schools or their homes depends on many factors and must be made on an individual basis. 
When considering whether students should work in schools or their homes, many factors must be taken into consideration. At the same time, they can build relationships with peers and have support from each other in a positive and safe environment",1
"This shift in focus can also help de-emphasize unhealthy options such as processed snacks, sugary drinks, and unhealthy condiments.

I would like to present this information to the school principal to discuss the need for an improved lunch menu with healthier options that are designed to meet the dietary needs of students.. Eating healthy foods is essential for maintaining an optimal level of energy, reducing the risk of serious illness, and improving overall health. 

By focusing on providing more wholesome options such as fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy snacks, we can increase the number of healthy options on the menu. 
As part of my research, I have identified several benefits of eating healthier food. Changes to the school's lunch menu can play a major role in encouraging students to make healthier choices",1

Respect, responsibility, and kindness are life lessons that are essential for a successful and fulfilling life. When applying for a job, employers appreciate those who demonstrate respect and responsibility in their resume. Respect, for example, is a life lesson that we should be constantly striving to practice. Furthermore, employers look kindly at applicants who can demonstrate kindness and consideration for others in the work place. Following life lessons like respecting your elders and being responsible with assignments may positively shape how employers view potential candidates. Respect for our peers, elders, and culture should always be taken into consideration. Respecting others, being responsible in various situations, and expressing kindness can all shape us for the better. Being kind to others can make a real difference in how someone is perceived by others.

These life lessons are especially important for those seeking employment. Moreover, expressing kindness and considering one another's feelings is an important behavior to maintain. Responsibilities like keeping promises, doing well in school, and respecting others should always be kept in mind.

"It is important to consider the various impacts of the extended school day and four-day work week proposal before any decisions are made.. 

Ultimately, any proposed change in school policies should be evaluated carefully, and the potential advantages and disadvantages for energy and resource conservation should be taken into account. 

However, this proposal also comes with some drawbacks. This idea has both its benefits and drawbacks, and they should be carefully weighed before any policy is enacted. For one, the extended school day would necessitate an extension of the school year, resulting in higher costs for the school in providing more instruction and greater disruption of winter and summer breaks. 
The push to conserve resources and energy is well underway across many different institutions, from businesses to schools. This can also lead to cost savings for the school while being better for the environment overall. This is because the school building can be kept at a more stable temperature for longer periods of time while still opening and closing fewer days, and energy-intensive operations like air conditioning and lighting can be used less frequently and for shorter periods of time. One proposal that is gaining traction is for schools to extend their day two hours, while shortening the school week to four days. Schools are particularly well suited to implement changes in practice that can significantly reduce energy usage, as many have already done through green renovations and adopting more sustainable practices. Finally, students—particularly older students—may find it difficult to adjust to longer days. Additionally, while the four-day work week may offer more flexibility for teachers, it could create more stress for staff and administrators, who would have to fit more work into a shorter amount of time. 

On the plus side, extending the school day by two hours, coupled with a four-day work week, can certainly help to conserve resources and energy",1
"It is possible to transform our character in order to overcome any limitations and help not only ourselves but others too. 
John Lubbock's statement that one's character is chosen by oneself is widely accepted as one of the fundamental truths of life. Maintaining a positive attitude and making sure that our character is founded in goodness and integrity is an integral part of fulfilling our potential and making the most of our lives.. In certain circumstances, it can be advantageous to make adjustments to our character, mindset, and goals. Although it is important to be taught proper behavior and etiquette by our parents and the people around us, ultimately how we act and think is determined by ourselves alone",1
"With each new challenge I tackle, I am reminded of the possibilities that await.. 
As I began to master the basics of coding, I realized that I had a newfound confidence in my abilities. What I had previously considered to be so far out of my reach became something that I could actually achieve. They taught themselves entirely new concepts and achieved amazing results.

The mastery of something not only gave me confidence, but also encouraged me to keep pushing the boundaries of what I can learn and what I can do. Suddenly, learning something new felt easier, as I had a solid foundation that I could build from.

To continue learning, I adopted strategies such as breaking down large problems into smaller ones, reviewing the solutions to challenges others had faced and expanding my horizons by learning new coding languages. I also observed colleagues who had already mastered one skill and moved onto learning another",1
"Additionally, I will look for ways to apply my talents in real-world scenarios, such as submitting stories and articles to publications or giving speeches and presentations at events. To hone these talents, I plan to practice and develop my craft in various ways. After considering what I'm passionate about and what I excel at, I pinpointed two possible talents: creative writing and public speaking. I'm excited to explore my potential and further develop these two talents in the coming months.. 
I recently took some time to look inward and reflect on my interests and skills. Going forward, I will read up on writing and public speaking, join online courses or forums, and network with people in the writing and speaking industries",1
"Having the freedom to pick and choose elective classes can also open the student up to unexpected interests they may not have known to have before. This choice allows students to explore different interests, diversify their education, and pursue passions both in and outside of their normal academic endeavors. This will encourage diligent study and draw out a creative and thoughtful approach to new material. Forcing students to take every elective class can be a waste of time because it does not allow for students to follow natural inclinations that are unique to them. 

In conclusion, allowing students the choice of what elective classes to take is of the utmost importance. 
The right to choose elective classes is of the utmost importance for students. 

Not every student enjoys the same classes, and it is to the benefit of the student, teacher, and school system if students are able to explore what they are genuinely interested in. 

Requiring students to take a certain set of elective classes could also result in a time-consuming process without a significant educational benefit. If students had more choice, their motivation and improved engagement could lead to better learning. Students can be made to complete classes they have little interest in, joining in lectures with minimal engagement or enthusiasm. Offering students the ability to evaluate each class and make an informed decision about their own personal education can have significant impacts on both the teaching staff and the student body, boosting motivation to learn and succeed in their studies.",1
"On one hand, it has enabled us to become more connected to people around the world, making long-distance relationships possible and providing us with a wealth of information about the lives of others. While it has enabled us to more easily stay connected, it has also forced us to prioritize virtual conversations over physical ones. In the workplace, employees can now communicate more effectively and efficiently through email and other online tools. On the other hand, it has also created a form of disconnection between people, as we increasingly engage with a virtual world instead of the physical one.

The effects of technology on human contact can be seen in virtually every aspect of life. 
Technology has drastically changed the way humans interact with one another. 

Overall, technology has impacted the lives of people in both positive and negative ways. Although technology has made communication more efficient and convenient, we must be mindful of its potential to hinder our relationships and maintain balance in our lives.. However, the sheer amount of information shared online has created a feeling of competition between users, leading to comparison and envy, which can be detrimental to our mental health. On the other hand, the reliance on these technologies has taken a toll on our personal connections, as we often connect with our coworkers and acquaintances through screens instead of face-to-face meetings.

In the realm of social media, technology has connected us to people in unprecedented ways, allowing us to maintain contact with long-lost friends and meet new people from all over the world. This has led to an increase in productivity and ease of communication, making it easier to stay in touch with colleagues over long distances",1

Methods for overcoming obstacles and adversities comes in different shapes and forms. It is essential to identify the source of the challenge or adversity and come up with different strategies to overcome it",1
"This could result in increased costs for the school and parents.. Furthermore, additional support can be provided by teachers, who can devote more time to helping students develop their understanding of the material. Students may face added stress if the extra two hours are used to add more coursework or other requirements. This could make it difficult for students to balance their school work with extracurricular activities and time to relax. With the extra two hours, students could spend more time on the subjects of their choosing and focus more on making progress and improving their grades. 

On the other hand, there are some potential disadvantages associated with a longer school day. 
One potential benefit of having a longer school day for high school students is that they would have more time to learn the subject material. Additionally, a longer school day could require additional resources such as additional staff, facilities, books, and other materials",1

Cell phones have become integral components of everyday life, and their presence in the classroom is no exception. 

The use of cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes can bring numerous advantages, both for students and teachers alike. Social media apps, instant messaging, and video conferencing can all be used to facilitate collaboration between students, while also providing teachers with a streamlined way to spread information such as assignment deadlines or upcoming events. For example, if a teacher is introducing a new topic, they could ask students to access an online encyclopedia or search engine to learn more about the subject. As technology advances, many teachers are beginning to recognize the potential benefits of allowing students to use their cell phones for educational purposes. By promoting greater engagement with learning, encouraging student collaboration, and providing convenient access to digital resources, cell phones can be a powerful tool to enhance any educational setting.. For instance, a teacher could use a messaging app to deliver updates about a group project or schedule an online meeting to discuss the progress of the assignment. When used properly, cell phones can provide convenient access to a wealth of digital resources, improve communication between students and teachers, and encourage greater participation in class. 

Cell phones can also benefit the learning environment by providing a simple way to connect with teachers and classmates.

"Clearly, it is natural to form an impression of someone or something based on one's first impressions, but it is equally important to not become complacent and instead give them a chance to demonstrate who and what they truly are.. However, after living together for a few months, I came to find that he was actually a loving and considerate person who put a significant effort into bettering himself in all aspects of life. Similar trends apply to animals too - our pet dog, Sabrina, was feral when we first adopted her, but soon became the most friendly and gentle creature one can imagine. Take for example my college roommate; when I first met him, I could not help but assume that he was arrogant and uncaring. We often associate positive qualities to people or animals we meet for the first time, based solely on how they appear or even the first few words they speak. 
First impressions can have a lasting impact. However, it is important to remember that first impressions can be changed, over time, with further knowledge and experience",1

Summer break is an important time for students to recharge and refocus after a busy school year. It gives them a much needed respite from academic pressures, a precious chance to relax, and the opportunity to pursue hobbies and interests that are not always available during the rest of the year. We must recognize the value of summer break for students and oppose any efforts to reduce it significantly.. With no break, they may become burned out and overwhelmed trying to manage both their academic and personal lives. Furthermore, shortening the summer break would make it difficult for students to break from their habits, explore new interests, and gain the perspective and balance they need to be successful. Taking away the summer break could also put students' mental health at risk",1

On the other hand, distance learning allows students the convenience of studying and engaging with course material at their own pace and in their own space. Traditional classroom learning may be the best alternative for some students, as it is an effective way to facilitate learning and engagement with course material and develop relationships with other peers. 
Traditional learning and distance learning are two popular options for students seeking to further their education. Moreover, students in a traditional classroom environment are able to develop relationships with other peers, which can help them understand complex material better. On the other hand, distance learning provides a convenient and often less expensive option for those seeking to further their education.

"The first student starts work on a task from the beginning of the vacation, while the other student relaxes and does not take action until the end. The tale gives us a powerful perspective on the importance of taking steady action to achieve our goals. In the story, the tortoise was determined to win the race and took consistent and steady action toward that goal, and the rabbit was distracted and ultimately stopped moving, thus allowing the tortoise to win.  

This story can be applied to two contrasting students taking summer vacation. We can all benefit from this story by reminding ourselves to take action and stay determined in order to succeed in anything we set out to do.. The student who takes action will have greater success in completing the task than the student who does not take action. Taking consistent and steady action will give them the resilience required to navigate potential challenges, pitfalls, and moments of doubt. 
The story of the tortoise and the rabbit is a timeless lesson of the power of hard work, determination, and taking action. 

Ultimately, the lesson of the tortoise and the rabbit gives us insight into the importance of time and how we can make it effective by doing something. Taking consistent action prevents failure and allows us to make progress towards our goals",1
"Labor is the Superior of Capital, and deserves much the higher consideration."" Through this quote, Jefferson emphasizes the importance of hard work and communicates the idea that being idle is not a desirable quality. Ultimately, Jefferson's quote holds true - labor is essential and being idle will prove to be ineffective in practical scenarios.. In addition, in a student's academic journey, being idle will prevent them from achieving their educational goals, so it is important to stay focused and motivated. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. For example, in the workplace, employees who are idle will not produce desirable results, so it is important that they stay engaged in their work. This idea can be applied to various practical scenarios. 
In his famous quote, Thomas Jefferson says that ""Labor is Prior to and Independent of Capital",1
"By participating in group activities, members become intimately familiar with different perspectives and experiences. Through participating in group tasks, members are encouraged to take critique and learn from their peers, ultimately receiving a more well-rounded understanding of themselves. 

Self-awareness and self-insight are key aspects of working with a group. 

Collaborating with others not only encourages increased awareness of the self, but also provides an opportunity to develop important interpersonal skills. Those who have the opportunity to work in a group setting should take full advantage of its numerous benefits.. By discussing and problem-solving together, members are pushed to hone their abilities to communicate, compromise, and conduct themselves in a respectful manner. 

In conclusion, group work serves as an invaluable opportunity for individuals to gain self-awareness and insight, better develop interpersonal skills, and gain a larger understanding of life. By interacting with others in a collaborative setting, individuals are able to recognize and appreciate their own strengths, weaknesses, and unique abilities. Working together with a group can help to develop the capacity to take criticism, a quality that is essential in any working environment.

Lastly, being part of a group drastically expands an individual’s knowledge of life. This knowledge gleaned from diverse points of view can then be used to expand one’s own personal understanding of life. 
Working in groups has a number of important benefits that cannot be achieved when working alone. From increased insight into the self and one’s own skills to improved interpersonal skills and a greater understanding of life, the experience of working within a group offers a variety of invaluable benefits",1
"On the plus side, students can enjoy a more relaxed, less stressful environment without having to worry about getting to school on time or dealing with the social pressures of the classroom. Furthermore, students attending classes from home can be more easily distracted by other tasks and activities that can take away from their learning and progress. Without the structure and support of a traditional school setting, it can be difficult for students to stay focused and set a daily study schedule. Additionally, students have access to a wealth of learning resources on the internet, and can utilize technology like video conferencing to interact with their peers and teachers.

However, there are also drawbacks to learning from home. Therefore, it is important for students to weigh the pros and cons of learning from home before deciding on whether or not it is the right choice for them.. 

In conclusion, while attending classes from home can offer increased flexibility and access to learning resources, it also poses some unique challenges that can make it difficult for students to focus and succeed. It can also be isolating since students don’t have the same sense of community they would have when they attend classes in person. 
Attending classes from home provides a unique learning experience compared to attending classes in person",1
"On the downside, too much reliance on the virtual world can create an imbalance in people's lives, causing them to prioritize spending time online over spending time in the physical world. It can also help to shape attitudes, providing access to information the average person would not have had in years past. 
Technology impacts the lives of people around the world in countless ways, both positive and negative. Ultimately, technology can be a force for good, provided it is used responsibly and in moderation.. People can become so accustomed to virtual connection that they may struggle to form meaningful relationships with people in their own community. In positive terms, technology can be a lifeline in emergency situations, allowing those in need to get the help they need quickly",1
"Failure is an inevitable part of life, and it plays a pivotal role in the pursuit of success. Even when starting a new job or feeling the pressure of not having complete confidence, failure can give you the opportunity to learn from your mistakes and make sure you don't make them again. It may seem insurmountable at times, but failure can often be the stepping stone to success. When life is mean and nasty, and criticism pours in from those around us, it is important to remember one's own self-determination and self-worth. The relationship between failure and success is one that, if handled correctly, can lead to incredible accomplishments.. Learning to fail and getting back up again is key to growing and achieving success. 
No matter where you are in life, or what you do, failure and success will always be at your side",1
"Though failure can be discouraging, it can lead to even greater successes if you stay enthusiastic and don't give up. Churchill's statement ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" is true in both of these cases. After failing the test three times, I eventually passed and was accepted into college. After many failed attempts, my aunt was finally able to visit her family in China. The same could be said of my experience with a failed English test in high school. 
My aunt's failed attempts to travel may have been discouraging, but looking back, I can see that these failures led to a great success. Success truly does come with perseverance.",1
"I’ve learned that it’s essential to be able to pick myself up and keep moving forward no matter what life throws my way. I believed that if I could just push through it, I would come out stronger on the other side. Instead of being overwhelmed and defeated by them, I try to remain focused and look for solutions. This philosophy has served me well throughout my life, and is something I encourage everyone to embrace.

I have always viewed my problems as a chance for me to do my best. With this understanding, I have been able to make thoughtful decisions and have avoided repeating the same mistakes.

In conclusion, I believe that problems can be a meaningful chance to do your best, hard times can build up strength, and issues can show someone how to do better in the future. It’s important to be able to take a step back, assess the situation, and come up with a way to prevent the same problem from occurring again. As someone who has struggled in the past, I know first-hand how hard times can build up strength.

Additionally, hard issues can show someone how to make better decisions in the future. When struggles arise, it’s an opportunity to develop resilience and learn from the experience. Through my own experiences, I have learned that these challenges can be difficult to overcome, but they can also be used to benefit and better oneself.. Whenever I encountered a difficult situation, I saw it as an opportunity for self-improvement and personal growth. 
Growing up, I faced many problems and hard times. By taking this approach, I have learned how to be resilient and determined, and am constantly striving to become better.

Hard times can also be a great teacher",1
"It is up to the students to decide if they would like to join an extra-curricular activity, not the school.. This, in turn, can lead to increased amounts of homework and less time to do it in. The increased strain on a student’s academic schedule and the strain of anxiety and fatigue can negatively affect a student’s education. Trying to balance an extra-curricular activity with their usual course of study can be taxing and puts students under tremendous stress. This can lead to poorer academic results, as well as mental and physical health issues. This ultimately leaves them with less time to spend on their academic courses and can lead to substandard work. 

In addition to the increased homework, students may also experience increased levels of fatigue and stress. 

When students are asked to join a club or participate in certain activities, it can impede their ability to focus on their schoolwork. 

It is often argued that schools should make students join extra-curricular activities, but this can have a damaging effect on students. Making students join extracurricular activities increases homework burdens and leads to a heightened level of fatigue and stress. 

With all these factors in mind, principals should not make students join extra-curricular activities",1
"Someone who practices regularly can learn to play each instrument quite quickly, while others might take longer. Distorted guitars are often used in progressive and heavy metal music for a heavier sound, with electric guitar solos often using this type of guitar. As for saxophones, their sound can be heard in all sorts of genres, including jazz, blues, rock, funk, Latin, reggae, and more. Lastly, clean guitars are favored by jazz, folk, and country musicians for their full, natural sound.

The amount of time it takes to learn an instrument will depend on the individual's level of commitment and dedication. An acoustic guitar has a signature warm and mellow sound, and is best-suited for acoustic and folk music. 

In conclusion, each of these three instruments has its own set of sounds and styles that make it distinct. With the right practice and dedication, any musician can master all of these instruments and use them to create their own unique music.. 
Pianos and saxophones are two of the most widely-used instruments in the world of music. With a piano, you can play a broad range of music, including classical, jazz, pop, rock, blues, and more. It's also important to note that not everyone learns at the same rate. 

Guitars come in several varieties, most notably acoustic, distorted, and clean",1
"And in personal life, a challenging situation (such as a conflict with a friend) can be an opportunity to practice effective communication or to learn more about how to peacefully resolve conflicts.

The quote also encourages us to learn from our mistakes. Similarly, in relationships, mistakes are inevitable—but rather than avoiding them, use mistakes as a chance to grow and learn how to be a better friend.

I agree with this quote as it encourages a growth mindset and emphasizes the importance of learning from mistakes. However, this quote can serve as a reminder that every problem is a chance for you to do your best, to become a better version of yourself. 
When faced with a problem, it's easy to become overwhelmed or to give up too quickly. For instance, if you fail a test, you can reflect on what you could have done differently and strive to make improvements next time. In sports, a difficult scrimmage could be the perfect opportunity to practice a difficult skill or to work on endurance. For example, in school you could use a difficult homework set to push yourself to learn the material more thoroughly rather than simply trying to get by or giving up. It reminds us that we have the potential to become better and that mistakes are not the end of our journey.",1
"On the other hand, it can also be incredibly stressful, as the sole responsibility for the outcome of your decisions lies squarely on your shoulders.

Seeking guidance from experts and authorities can also offer its own set of benefits and drawbacks. 
Making your own life decisions can be both highly rewarding and filled with challenges. It offers a sense of individualism, autonomy, and satisfaction in knowing that your decisions are entirely based on your own personal values and feelings. However, this can also create a sense of passivity or dependence upon others, as the bulk of the decisions are made by those others rather than by yourself.

Ultimately, making your own decisions and seeking guidance from experts and authorities can each offer advantages depending on your needs and preferences. It is important to be mindful of both the benefits and potential shortcomings of each approach, so that your decision-making process can be tailored to meet the needs of your particular situation.. Expert advice may provide a level of security and confidence within your decisions, knowing that their experience and knowledge can help guide you properly",1

When teaching in a classroom where both younger and older students are present, it is important to remember that each student has different learning needs. Finally, be conscious of the different interests of the younger students when setting the learning objectives; this will help them stay engaged and will also ensure that everyone in the classroom can learn the material.. Additionally, it is important to demonstrate passion for the topic; this will help motivate the students and can help make learning more fun. Creative methods, such as using games, stories, and visuals, can help keep young students engaged and can also help explain difficult topics. When introducing a new topic, present it in a way that is age-appropriate to all students in the class",1

To sum up, Thomas Jefferson's quote clearly emphasizes the importance of consistent action in achieving our goals. Being inactive and idling will only lead to stagnation, while taking small steps consistently will ultimately move us towards our aspirations.. 
Thomas Jefferson's quote encapsulates a powerful truth: taking action is essential to achieving our goals. Making regular trips to the gym or sticking to a healthy diet are small steps which, over time, can have a hugely positive impact. Small daily actions, like practising for just 15 minutes each day, add up to big accomplishments over time. Being inactive, or idling, will only lead to inaction and a lack of progress. It is only by consistently taking small steps that we are able to make progress towards our goals. 

On the other hand, that same principle of consistent action applies to other areas of our lives, such as our health and fitness goals. For example, if you want to learn to play the violin, you must commit to regular practice sessions to make real progress",1

Take the situation of Joe, for instance. 

Finally, there's Toni, who had been taking a break from her after school homework club one day to enjoy her favorite video game. Joe had been trying to make time to attend his daughter's piano recital the past few weeks, but had to keep missing it due to the demands of his after school homework club. It has been shown to negatively impact family time, significantly reduce the potential for sports and activities, and limit gaming opportunities. This shows how we should consider other options besides after school homework club to benefit our children.. 

The examples of Joe, Sarah, and Toni show how much of an impact after school homework club can have on recreational activities and family time. Despite being an ace player, she was unable to participate in the game due to her class-like commitment to her after school homework club. She was about to reach new levels when her friends in her after school homework club group chat asked where she was. Due to the fear of being criticized for not fulfilling her commitment, she gave up her beloved gaming session, as well as potentially losing out on new subscribers to her YouTube channel. His daughter was disappointed and he had to miss the one thing he was looking forward to. 

Similarly, Sarah was asked to leave her basketball team on account of her having to attend her after school homework club every day. 
When it comes to the debate of whether or not after school homework club should be allowed in our schools, there are compelling arguments against it",1
"

After high school, I was determined to pursue my ambition of becoming a professional dancer. Even when I was feeling defeated and disheartened, I would look to the inspiring example of figures such as Oprah Winfrey and knew that if they could go from humble beginnings to global superstardom through hard work and perseverance, then so could I.

Although luck clearly does play a part in success, there is no substitute for hard work. But I quickly realized it wasn't going to be easy to break into that competitive field. Through hard work and dedication, I achieved my dream of becoming a professional dancer. There was a fierce competition and not everyone had the talent or the dedication to make it in the industry. As well as feeling an intense sense of accomplishment, I felt a deep sense of pride in knowing that my success was entirely down to my own hard work and determination.. So for me, it was a clear choice - hard work and determination was the only way forward.

I worked tirelessly with a single-minded focus, putting in 20-hour days and foregoing most luxuries in order to reach my goal",1
"Students receive a much needed break from their hectic schedules and have the opportunity to spend quality time with family and friends. Additionally, if the summer break is preserved, students can also have more time to pursue personal interests and relax, as well as engage in activities that can help them stay engaged and healthy.

Aside from providing physical rest, keeping the length of summer break as it is, gives students more time to nurture their social relationships. During this period, students can build and strengthen family and peer relationships. For students who have had to work hard in school throughout the year, this break provides a chance to rest and recharge. Furthermore, with more time over the summer months, students can explore different interests and volunteer in the community. It allows students to rest after a stressful year, and enjoy the summer months with family and friends. With longer breaks, students can benefit from getting much needed rest from a long academic year, and also foster strong family and friend connections. Yet, there are some who believe this break should be shorter, to maximize learning opportunities. In short, summer break should stay as it is to provide more opportunities for students.. Additionally, they can explore their interests and volunteer in the community. 

In conclusion, summer break should remain in its current length. However, I believe that summer break should remain as it is and this essay will explain why.

Currently, summer break lasts about 10 to 11 weeks, beginning in June and ending in August. Studies show that strong family and friend relationships are essential to better mental health. 

Summer break is an important part of the educational system",1
"Additionally, those around them can pressure them to act in certain ways, and it often requires strength to defy these pressures and stay true to one’s values.

Overall, it is important to remember that while people should strive to be in control of the person they want to be, they must also recognize that the environment they live in can influence their character significantly. 

For example, a person may be raised in a household where they see particular behaviors modeled, either positive or negative. This can have a lasting effect on their character, as the things they observe can shape their beliefs and values. However, it is important to acknowledge that this view ignores the fact that people are heavily influenced by those around them, and their environment can have a significant impact on their character. It is possible to be strongly impacted by those around us, both positively and negatively, and it is our decisions that will determine whether we are actively resisting or submitting to these influences.. It implies that each person is ultimately in control of their character and behavior, and it is their decisions that determine what kind of person they become. 
The statement ""Your character will be what yourself choose to make it"" is a powerful idea that is worth considering",1

Extending the school day has been a hot topic of debate in many countries for a variety of reasons. Ultimately, the decision to extend the school day should be made with the interests of students at heart.. On the one hand, some research suggests that by adding two hours to the school day, students could be exposed to a greater variety of topics while engaged in directed learning, and would have more time to explore their individual interests. Factors such as the age of the students and the quality of instruction being provided, as well as the availability of resources and support structures, must all be taken into account. On the other hand, the additional hours spent in the classroom could be seen as an unnecessary burden, with student wellbeing and learning outcomes suffering due to fatigue and boredom. In order to more fully understand the potential implications of such a change, it is essential to consider the educational context in which this decision would be made",1
"Overall, there are numerous reasons to go outdoors and reap the rewards of the experience.. Outdoor activities include sports, walking, and cycling to name a few. 
Spending time outdoors has many advantages. From physical exercise to mental health benefits, going outdoors can have a wide ranging positive impact. This may be due to people's saturation or over-dependence on indoor activities such as gaming. Without a balanced amount of outdoor time, people can be prone to lack of motivation and even depression. It is also important to be aware of the weather and any potential dangers, like slippery surfaces. Listening to music outdoors can be a pleasant and rewarding experience. Outdoor games such as Touch football and Capture the Flag offer exciting opportunities for groups of people to go outside and enjoy while getting healthy exercise. However, it is important to take safety precautions such as wearing earplugs and avoiding loud noise",1
"Being in nature can help relieve stress and bring peace of mind. Not only is it the perfect way to enjoy each other’s company, but also you can take time away from electronic devices and get back in touch with nature. However, outdoor activities provide a way to come together and reconnect with each other. 
Spending quality time with family has become increasingly difficult in our digital age. Exploring the world and meeting new people are just a few of the ways that you can bring the family together and have a great time. Whether it's going on a nature hike, camping, or some other outdoor activity, it’s a great opportunity to bond with family and reap the stress relief benefits of being outdoors.",1
"For example, when Leisa Urbay became involved with her local Humane Society, she honed her communication skills, learned about event planning, and began to understand the inner workings of non-profit organizations. With the pressure of maintaining a high GPA while participating in extracurriculars, Noah ultimately had to make a difficult decision and quit his robotics team. From team bonding in sports to making new friendships in clubs, extracurriculars offer many students the chance to form friendships with individuals who share their same interests. 
Extracurricular activities offer many students the opportunity to develop their skills, foster new friendships, and explore various interests. An example of this is soccer team captain Alex Wilson. These friendships can last well past the student’s involvement in the activity. With practices, meetings, and competitions, it can be difficult to manage the time demands of an activity alongside an already-busy academic schedule. However, when the time commitment of an activity becomes too overwhelming, it is important for students to reassess their priorities so they can best balance school and extracurriculars.. This opened the door to several different career paths, and she went on to become a successful marketing director for an animal shelter.

One potential challenge of extracurriculars is the time commitment required. From volunteer work to sports teams to clubs and organizations, there are lots of benefits of involvement in extracurriculars, but there are also some potential challenges. This can be especially tough for students like Noah Smith, who was juggling the demands of an AP-level course load with a commitment to a robotics team. From learning important soft skills like teamwork and problem solving, to developing industry-specific skills and knowledge, there are lots of practical benefits that come with extracurriculars. 

One of the major benefits to participating in extracurriculars is the connections and friendships students can build. 

Another pro of participating in extracurricular activities is career development. 

In conclusion, extracurricular activities have lots of benefits that can help students build relationships, hone important skills, and get ahead in their career. Alex joined his high school’s soccer team as a freshman and by senior year had made lifelong friendships with several of his teammates",1
"You may be able to use your imagination to come up with a creative solution, but without the knowledge of basic mathematics, it is unlikely that you will be able to come up with the correct answer. 
Albert Einstein's quote, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge,"" is an insightful statement. In this case, not having knowledge can get you in trouble.. With imagination, we are able to think outside the box and explore possibilities that may not be immediately obvious. Knowledge provides us with the facts, and imagination gives us the power to use them in creative and innovative ways. Combining the two together can lead to discoveries and solutions that are otherwise unattainable.

For example, imagine a scenario in which you are trying to solve a math problem without the knowledge of basic mathematics",1
"To ensure that students stay on top of their studies, it is important to limit the length of vacations and create regular breaks throughout the year.. During a prolonged break, the brain is likely to forget more information, leading to fewer opportunities for recall. Furthermore, experiences during a long vacation can affect a student's ability to pay attention in class, leading to a decreased understanding of the material. 
Recent studies have shown that having a longer winter break than summer poses a threat to students’ ability to retain information. This is because of the physiological impact that extended vacations have on the brain",1
"
The potential addition of an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day for students could have a significant impact on their lives. In conclusion, the implications of adding extra time to the school day should be carefully considered before any additional hours are added.. Additionally, this increase in time may limit the amount of time available for family and peer relationships due to the addition of more school hours. For example, it is possible that student performance could improve if they are given extra time to focus on studies or better understand the material. Furthermore, local school districts could be faced with strain due to the heightened burden of providing teachers, resources, and updating curriculum to accommodate the addition",1
"It is also worth noting that attending school is important for students from lower-income families, as it provides structure in their lives and the resources they need to pursue higher education, which are not always easily accessible. It is important for students to make use of the resources that attending school offers, in order to further their educational goals in the long run.. One big advantage of attending school is the hands-on learning opportunities, as students get to participate in experiments and practical projects which are impossible to do online. 

In conclusion, while taking online classes or video conferences can be attractive due to convenience, attending school is ultimately a more efficient approach for students to gain the necessary academic progress and crucial skills. On the other hand, one of the main advantages of taking online classes or video conferences is that students can have a flexible learning schedule, and study according to their own pace.

Ultimately, attending school is more effective for students in the long run, as it offers a more comprehensive educational approach. 
Attending school and taking online classes or video conferences are both popular educational approaches these days, but they differ in several ways. Additionally, attending school gives students the chance to develop crucial social skills like working together and communication, which are essential for success in life, but are not possible in online classes or video conferences. Attending school requires students to physically go to a classroom and interact with their teacher and fellow students, while taking online classes or video conferences (especially during the pandemic) means that students can learn from home. 

There are several advantages and drawbacks to attending school compared to taking online classes or video conferences. Having an experienced teacher to guide students in the classroom and take care of when they are having difficulties is much more beneficial than learning all by themselves at home",1
"However, she persevered and eventually found someone who believed in her story and was willing to take a chance. It plays a pivotal role in helping us to develop qualities such as resilience in order to reach our goals. 

All in all, failure is a concept that should not be feared, but seen as an important stepping stone to achieving ultimate success. For example, Thomas Edison famously remarked that failure taught him a thousand ways not to build a lightbulb. 
Excerpt:

Throughout history, failure has often been the precursor to success, and Winston Churchill is famously quoted for remarking that “success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” This simple quotation succinctly illustrates an important truth- failure should not be feared, but embraced. 

First, failure can often provide valuable insight and guidance in our lives. This perspective allowed him to look at each instance of failure as a lesson, rather than an impediment to success. Rowling, who got several rejections in her attempt to find a publisher for her now renowned book Harry Potter. As an example of this, Michael Jordan was famously cut from his high school basketball team, but through hard work and dedication he became one of the greatest basketball players of all time. It is difficult to succeed without first having failed. Those that can effectively learn from their mistakes and use their failures as a source of motivation can become more resilient. Thus, it is important to remember Winston Churchill's words- that success is not final, failure is not fatal; it is the courage to continue that counts.. To better understand this concept, it is important to consider two main reasons why failure can lead to success. Another example of this notion is when Oprah Winfrey failed a major quiz in high school. Another case in point is J.K. Though originally considering it a disappointment, Oprah remarked later that “it was the best thing”, as it changed her attitude towards learning and inspired her to take courses she was genuinely passionate about.

Second, failure can provide an emotional sense of resilience that is necessary for success. The knowledge that one gains through failing can help them to better equip themselves for future success",1
